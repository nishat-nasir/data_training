verse,story
"O my friends, hearken to this tale: in truth it is the very marrow of our inward state. In olden time there was a king to whom belonged the power temporal and also the power spiritual. It chanced that one day he rode with his courtiers to the chase. On the king's highway the king espied a handmaiden: the soul of the king was enthralled by her. Forasmuch as the bird, his soul, was fluttering in its cage, he gave money and bought the handmaiden.",0
"After he had bought her and won to his desire, by Divine destiny she sickened. A certain man had an ass but no pack-saddle: (as soon as) he got a saddle, the wolf carried away his ass. He had a pitcher, but no water could be obtained: when he found water, the pitcher broke. The king gathered the physicians together from left and right and said to them, “The life of us both is in your hands. My life is of no account, (but) she is the life of my life. I am in pain and wounded: she is my remedy.",0
"Whoever heals her that is my life will bear away with him my treasure and pearls, large and small.” They all answered him, saying, “We will hazard our lives and summon all our intelligence and put it into the common stock. Each one of us is the Messiah of a world (of people): in our hands is a medicine for every pain.” In their arrogance they did not say, “If God will”; therefore God showed unto them the weakness of Man. I mean (a case in which) omission of the saving clause is (due to) a hardness of heart; not the mere saying of these words, for that is a superficial circumstance.",0
"How many a one has not pronounced the saving clause, and yet his soul is in harmony with the soul of it! The more cures and remedies they applied, the more did the illness increase, and the need was not fulfilled. The sick girl became (thin) as a hair, (while) the eyes of the king flowed with tears of blood, like a river. By Divine destiny, oxymel produced bile, and oil of almonds was increasing the dryness. From (giving) myrobalan constipation resulted, relaxation ceased; and water fed the flames, like naphtha. How it became manifest to the king that the physicians were unable to cure the handmaiden, and how he turned his face towards God and dreamed of a holy man.",0
"When the king saw the powerlessness of those physicians, he ran bare-footed to the mosque. He entered the mosque and advanced to the mihráb (to pray): the prayer-carpet was bathed in the king's tears.On coming to himself out of the flood of ecstasy (faná) he opened his lips in goodly praise and laud, Saying, “O Thou whose least gift is the empire of the world, what shall I say, in as much as Thou knowest the hidden thing? O Thou with whom we always take refuge in our need, once again we have missed the way.",0
"But Thou hast said, ‘Albeit I know thy secret, nevertheless declare it forthwith in thine outward act.’” When from the depths of his soul he raised a cry (of supplication), the sea of Bounty began to surge. Slumber overtook him in the midst of weeping: he dreamed that an old man appeared And said, “Good tidings, O king! Thy prayers are granted. If to-morrow a stranger come for thee, he is from me. When he comes, he is the skilled physician: deem him veracious, for he is trusty and true.",0
"In his remedy behold absolute magic, in his temperament behold the might of God!” When the promised hour arrived and day broke and the sun, (rising) from the east, began to burn the stars, The king was in the belvedere, expecting to see that which had been shown mysteriously. He saw a person excellent and worshipful, a sun amidst a shadow, Coming from afar, like the new moon (in slenderness and radiance): he was nonexistent, though existent in the form of phantasy.",0
"In the spirit phantasy is as naught, (yet) behold a world (turning) on a phantasy! Their peace and their war (turn) on a phantasy, and their pride and their shame spring from a phantasy; (But) those phantasies which ensnare the saints are the reflexion of the fair ones of the garden of God. In the countenance of the stranger-guest was appearing that phantasy which the king beheld in his dream. The king himself, instead of the chamberlains, went forward to meet his guest from the Invisible.",0
"Both were seamen who had learned to swim, the souls of both were knit together without sewing. The king said, “Thou wert my Beloved (in reality), not she; but in this world deed issues from deed. O thou who art to me (as) Mustafá (Mohammed), while I am like unto ‘Umar—I will gird my loins to do thee service.” Beseeching the Lord, who is our Helper, to help us to observe self-control in all circumstances, and explaining the harmful and pernicious consequences of indiscipline. Let us implore God to help us to self-control: one who lacks self-control is deprived of the grace of the Lord.",0
"The undisciplined man does not maltreat himself alone, but he sets the whole world on fire. A table (of food) was coming down from heaven without headache (trouble) and without selling and buying, (When) some of the people of Moses cried disrespectfully, “Where is garlic and lentils?” (Straightway) the heavenly bread and dishes (of food) were cut off: there remained (for all of them) the toil of sowing and (labouring with) mattock and scythe.Again, when Jesus made intercession, God sent food and bounty (from heaven) on trays, But once more the insolent fellows omitted to show respect and, like beggars, snatched away the viands.",0
"(Although) Jesus entreated them, saying, “This is lasting and will not fail from off the earth.” To show suspicion and greed at the table of Majesty is ingratitude. Because of those impudent wretches who were blinded by greed, that gate of mercy was closed upon them. On account of withholding the poor-tax no rain-clouds arise, and in consequence of fornication the plague spreads in all directions. Whatever befalls thee of gloom and sorrow is the result of irreverence and insolence withal.",0
"Any one behaving with irreverence in the path of the Friend is a brigand who robs men, and he is no man. Through discipline this Heaven has been filled with light, and through discipline the angels became immaculate and holy. By reason of irreverence the sun was eclipsed, and insolence caused an ‘Azázíl to be turned back from the door. The meeting of the king with the divine physician whose coming had been announced to him in a dream. He (the king) opened his hands and clasped him to his breast and received him, like love, into his heart and soul, And began to kiss his hand and brow and inquire concerning his home and journey.",0
"(So) with many a question he led him to the dais. “At last,” said he, “I have found a treasure by being patient.” He said (also), “O gift from God and defence against trouble, (O thou who art) the meaning of ‘Patience is the key of joy’! O thou whose countenance is the answer to every question, by thee hard knots are loosed without discussion. Thou interpretest all that is in our hearts, thou givest a helping hand to every one whose foot is in the mire. Welcome, O chosen one, O approved one! If thou vanish, Destiny will come (upon us) and the wide room will be straitened.",0
"Thou art the protector of the people. He that desires (thee) not hath gone to perdition. Nay, verily, if he do not refrain…!” When that meeting and bounteous (spiritual) repast was over, he took his hand and conducted him to the harem. How the king led the physician to the bedside of the sick girl, that he might see her condition. He rehearsed the tale of the invalid and her illness, and then seated him beside the sick (girl). The physician observed the colour of her face, (felt) her pulse, and (inspected) her urine; he heard both the symptoms and the (secondary) causes of her malady. He said, “None of the remedies which they have applied builds up (health): they (the false physicians) have wrought destruction.",0
"They were ignorant of the inward state. I seek refuge with God from that which they invent.” He saw the pain, and the secret became open to him, but he concealed it and did not tell the king. Her pain was not from black or yellow bile: the smell of every firewood appears from the smoke. From her sore grief he perceived that she was heart-sore; well in body, but stricken in heart. Being in love is made manifest by soreness of heart: there is no sickness like heartsickness.",0
"The lover's ailment is separate from all other ailments: love is the astrolabe of the mysteries of God. Whether love be from this (earthly) side or from that (heavenly) side, in the end it leads us yonder. Whatsoever I say in exposition and explanation of Love, when I come to Love (itself) I am ashamed of that (explanation). Although the commentary of the tongue makes (all) clear, yet tongueless love is clearer. Whilst the pen was making haste in writing, it split upon itself as soon as it came to Love.",0
"In expounding it (Love), the intellect lay down (helplessly) like an ass in the mire: it was Love (alone) that uttered the explanation of love and loverhood. The proof of the sun is the sun (himself): if thou require the proof, do not avert thy face from him! If the shadow gives an indication of him, the sun (himself) gives spiritual light every moment. The shadow, like chat in the night-hours, brings sleep to thee; when the sun rises the moon is cloven asunder. There is nothing in the world so wondrous strange as the sun, (but) the Sun of the spirit is everlasting: it hath no yesterday.",0
"Although the external sun is unique, still it is possible to imagine one resembling it; The spiritual Sun, which is beyond the aether, hath no peer in the mind or externally. Where is room in the imagination for His essence, that the like of Him should come into the imagination? When news arrived of the face of Shamsu’ddín (the Sun of the Religion), the sun of the fourth heaven drew in its head (hid itself for shame). Since his name has come (to my lips), it behoves me to set forth some hint of his bounty.",0
"At this moment my Soul has plucked my skirt: he has caught the perfume of Joseph's vest. (He said): “For the sake of our years of companionship, recount one of those sweet ecstasies, That earth and heaven may laugh (with joy), that intellect and spirit and eye may increase a hundredfold.” (I said): “Do not lay tasks on me, for I have passed away from myself (faná); my apprehensions are blunted and I know not how to praise. Everything that is said by one who has not returned to consciousness, if he constrains himself or boastfully exaggerates, is unseemly.",0
"How should I—not a vein of mine is sensible—describe that Friend who hath no peer? The description of this severance and this heart's blood do thou at present leave over till another time.” He said: “Feed me, for I am hungry, and make haste, for Time is a cutting sword. The Súfí is the son of the (present) time, O comrade: it is not the rule of the Way to say ‘To-morrow.’ Art not thou indeed a Súfí, then? That which is (in hand) is reduced to naught by postponing the payment.”",0
"I said to him: “It is better that the secret of the Friend should be disguised: do thou hearken (to it as implied) in the contents of the tale. It is better that the lovers' secret should be told in the talk of others.” He said: “Tell it forth openly and nakedly and without unfaithfulness: do not put me off, O trifler! Lift the veil and speak nakedly, for I do not wear a shirt when I sleep with the Adored One.” I said: “If He should become naked in (thy) vision, neither wilt thou remain nor thy bosom nor thy waist. ",0
"Ask thy wish, but ask with measure: a blade of straw will not support the mountain. If the Sun, by whom this world is illumined, should approach a little (nearer), all will be burned. Do not seek trouble and turmoil and bloodshed: say no more concerning the Sun of Tabriz!” This (mystery) hath no end: tell of the beginning. Go, relate the conclusion of this tale. How that saint demanded of the king to be alone with the handmaiden for the purpose of discovering her malady. He said: “O king, make the house empty; send away both kinsfolk and strangers.",0
"Let no one listen in the entrance-halls, that I may ask certain things of this handmaiden.” The house was left empty, and not one inhabitant (remained): nobody save the physician and that sick girl. Very gently he said (to her), “Where is thy native town? for the treatment suitable to the people of each town is separate. And in that town who is related to thee? With what hast thou kinship and affinity?” He laid his hand on her pulse and put questions, one by one, about the injustice of Heaven.",0
"When a thorn darts into any one's foot, he sets his foot upon his knee, And keeps searching for its head with the point of a needle, and if he does not find it, he keeps moistening it (the place) with his lip. A thorn in the foot is so hard to find: how (then) is it with a thorn in the heart? Answer (that)! If every base fellow had seen the thorn in the heart, when would sorrows gain the upper hand over any one? Somebody sticks a thorn under a donkey's tail: the donkey does not know how to get rid of it: he starts jumping.",0
"He jumps, and the thorn strikes more firmly (pierces deeper): it needs an intelligent person to extract a thorn. In order to get rid of the thorn, the donkey from irritation and pain went on kicking and dealing blows in a hundred places, (But) that thorn-removing physician was an expert: putting his hand on one spot after another, he tested (it). He inquired of the girl concerning her friends, by way of narrative, And she disclosed to the physician (many) circumstances touching her home and (former) masters and fellow-townsmen.",0
"He listened to her story (while) he continued to observe her pulse and its beating, So that at whosoever's name her pulse should begin to throb, (he might know that) that person is the object of her soul's desire in the world. He counted up the friends in her native town; then he mentioned another town by name. He said: “When you went forth from your own town, in which town did you live mostly?” She mentioned the name of a certain town and from that too she passed on (to speak of another, and meanwhile) there was no change in the colour of her face or in her pulse.",0
"Masters and towns, one by one, she told of, and about dwelling-place and bread and salt. She told stories of many a town and many a house, (and still) no vein of her quivered nor did her cheek grow pale. Her pulse remained in its normal state, unimpaired, till he asked about Samarcand, the (city) sweet as candy. (Thereat) her pulse jumped and her face went red and pale (by turns), for she had been parted from a man of Samarcand, a goldsmith. When the physician found out this secret from the sick (girl), he discerned the source of that grief and woe.",0
"He said: “Which is his quarter in passing (through the town)?” “Sar-i Pul (Bridgehead),” she replied, “and Ghátafar street.” Said he: “I know what your illness is and I will at once display the arts of magic in delivering you. Be glad and care-free and have no fear, for I will do to you that which rain does to the meadow. I will be anxious for you, be not you anxious: I am kinder to you than a hundred fathers. Beware! tell not this secret to any one, not though the king should make much inquiry from you.",0
"When your heart becomes the grave of your secret, that desire of yours will be gained more quickly.” The Prophet said that any one who hides his inmost thought will soon attain to the object of his desire. When seeds are hidden in the earth, their inward secret becomes the verdure of the garden. If gold and silver were not hidden, how would they get nourishment (grow and ripen) in the mine? The promises and soothing words of the physician made the sick (girl) safe (free) from fear.",0
"There are true promises, grateful to the heart; there are false promises, fraught with disquietude. The promise of the noble is current (sterling) coin; the promise of the unworthy becomes anguish of soul. How the saint, having discovered the (cause of) the illness, laid it before the king. Then he arose and went to see the king and acquainted him with a portion of that matter. “The (best) plan,” said he, “is that we should bring the man here for the sake of (curing) this malady. Summon the goldsmith from that far country; beguile him with gold and robes of honour.”",0
"The king sent thither one or two messengers, clever men and competent and very just. How the king sent messengers to Samarcand to fetch the goldsmith. To Samarcand came the two messengers for the goldsmith debonair and wanton, Saying, “O fine master, perfect in knowledge, thou whose quality (of perfection in thy craft) is famous in (all) the lands, Lo, such-and-such a king hath chosen thee for (thy skill in) the goldsmith's craft, because thou art eminent. Look now, receive this robe of honour and gold and silver; when thou comest (to the king), thou wilt be a favourite and boon- companion.”",0
"The man saw the much wealth and the many robes: he was beguiled, he parted from his town and children. Blithely the man came into the road, unaware that the king had formed a design against his life. He mounted an Arab horse and sped on joyously: (what really was) the price of his blood he deemed a robe of honour. O (fool), who with a hundred consents thyself with thine own foot didst enter on the journey to the fated ill! In his fancy (were dreams of) riches, power, and lordship. Said ‘Azrá‘íl (the Angel of Death), “Go (thy way). Yes, thou wiltget (them)!”",0
"When the stranger arrived (and turned) from the road, the physician brought him into the presence of the king. Proudly and delicately they conducted him to the king of kings, that he might burn (like a moth) on that candle of Tiráz. The king beheld him, showed great regard (for him), and entrusted to him the treasure house (full) of gold. Then the physician said to him: “O mighty Sultan, give the handmaiden to this lord, In order that the handmaiden may be happy in union with him, and that the water of union with him may put out the fire (of passion).”",0
"The king bestowed on him that moon-faced one and wedded those twain (who were) craving (each other's) company. During the space of six months they were satisfying their desire, till the girl was wholly restored to health. Thereafter he prepared for him a potion, so that when he drank it he began to dwindle away before her. When because of sickness his beauty remained not, the soul of the girl remained not in his pestilence (deadly toils). Since he became ugly and ill-favoured and sallow-cheeked, little by little he became cold (irksome and unpleasing) in her heart.",0
"Those loves which are for the sake of a colour (outward beauty) are not love: in the end they are a disgrace. Would that he too had been disgrace (deformity) altogether, so that that evil judgement might not have come to pass upon him! Blood ran from his eye (that flowed with tears) like a river; his (handsome) face became the enemy of his life. The peacock's plumage is its enemy: O many the king who hath been slain by his magnificence! He said, “I am the muskdeer on account of whose gland that hunter shed my pure (innocent) blood.",0
"Oh, I am the fox of the field whose head they (the hunters springing forth) from the covert cut off for the sake of the fur. Oh, I am the elephant whose blood was shed by the blow of the mahout for the sake of the bone (ivory). He who hath slain me for that which is other than I, does not he know that my blood sleepeth not (will not rest unavenged)? To-day it lies on me and to-morrow it lies on him: when does the blood of one such as I am go to waste like this? Although the wall casts a long shadow, (yet at last) the shadow turns back again towards it.",0
"This world is the mountain, and our action the shout: the echo of the shouts comes (back) to us.” He said this and at the (same) moment went under the earth (gave up the ghost). The handmaiden was purged of pain and love, Because love of the dead is not enduring, because the dead one is never coming (back) to us; (But) love of the living is every moment fresher than a bud in the spirit and in the sight. Choose the love of that Living One who is everlasting, who gives thee to drink of the wine that increases life.",0
"Choose the love of Him from whose love all the prophets gained power and glory. Do not say, “We have no admission to that King.” Dealings with the generous are not difficult. Setting forth how the slaying and poisoning of the goldsmith was (prompted) by Divine suggestion, not by sensual desire and wicked meditation. The slaying of this man by the hand of the physician was not (done) on account of hope or fear. He did not slay him to humour the king, (he did not slay him) until the Divine command and inspiration came. As for the boy whose throat was cut by Khadir, the vulgar do not comprehend the mystery thereof.",0
"He that receives from God inspiration and answer (to his prayer), whatsoever he may command is the essence of right. If one who bestows (spiritual) life should slay, it is allowable: he is the (Divine) vicegerent, and his hand is the hand of God. Like Ismá‘íl (Ishmael), lay your head before him; gladly and laughingly give up your soul before his dagger, In order that your soul may remain laughing unto eternity, like the pure soul of Ahmad (Mohammed) with the One (God). Lovers drain the cup of joy at the moment when the fair ones slay them with their own hand.",0
"The king did not commit that bloodshed because of lust: cease from thinking evil and disputing. You thought that he committed a foul crime, (but) in (the state of) purity how should the sublimation leave (any) alloy (behind)? The purpose of this (severe) discipline and this rough treatment is that the furnace may extract the dross from the silver. The testing of good and bad is in order that the gold may boil and bring the scum to the top. If his act were not the inspiration of God, he would have been a dog that rends (its prey), not a king.",0
"He was unstained by lust and covetousness and passion: (what) he did (was) good, but good that wore the aspect of evil. If Khadir stove the boat in the sea, (yet) in Khadir's staving there are a hundred rightnesses. The imagination of Moses, notwithstanding his (spiritual) illumination and excellence, was screened from (the comprehension of) that (act of Khadir). Do not thou fly without wings! That (deed of the king) is a red rose (worthy of praise); do not call it blood (murder). He is intoxicated with Reason; do not call him a madman. Had it been his desire to shed the blood of a Moslem, I am an infidel if I would have mentioned his name (with praise).",0
"The highest heaven trembles at praise of the wicked, and by praise of him the devout man is moved to think evil. He was a king and a very heedful king; he was elect and the elect (favourite) of God. One who is slain by a king like this, he (the king) leads him to fortune and to the best (most honourable) estate. Unless he (the king) had seen advantage to him (the goldsmith) in doing violence to him, how should that absolute Mercy have sought to do violence? The child trembles at the barber's scalpel (but) the fond mother is happy in that pain (of her child).",0
"He takes half a life and gives a hundred lives (in exchange): he gives that which enters not into your imagination. You are judging (his actions) from (the analogy of) yourself, but you have fallen far, far (away from the truth). Consider well! The story of the greengrocer and the parrot and the parrot's spilling the oil in the shop. There was a greengrocer who had a parrot, a sweet-voiced green talking parrot. (Perched) on the bench, it would watch over the shop (in the owner's absence) and talk finely to all the traders. In addressing human beings it would speak (like them); it was (also) skilled in the song of parrots.",1
"(Once) it sprang from the bench and flew away; it spilled the bottles of rose-oil. Its master came from the direction of his house and seated himself on the bench at his ease as a merchant does. (Then) he saw the bench was full of oil and his clothes greasy; he smote the parrot on the head: it was made bald by the blow. For some few days it refrained from speech; the greengrocer, in repentance, heaved deep sighs, Tearing his beard and saying, “Alas! the sun of my prosperity has gone under the clouds.",1
"Would that my hand had been broken (powerless) at that moment! How (ever) did I strike (such a blow) on the head of that sweet-tongued one?” He was giving presents to every dervish, that he might get back the speech of his bird. After three days and three nights, he was seated on the bench, distraught and sorrowful, like a man in despair, Showing the bird every sort of marvel (in the hope) that maybe it would begin to speak. Meanwhile a bare-headed dervish, clad in a jawlaq (coarse woollen frock), passed by, with a head hairless as the outside of bowl and basin.",1
"Thereupon the parrot began to talk, screeched at the dervish and said, “Hey, fellow! How were you mixed up with the bald, O baldpate? Did you, then, spill oil from the bottle?” The bystanders laughed at the parrot's inference, because it deemed the wearer of the frock to be like itself. Do not measure the actions of holy men by (the analogy of) yourself, though shér (lion) and shír (milk) are similar in writing. On this account the whole world is gone astray: scarcely any one is cognisant of God's Abdál (Substitutes).",1
"They set up (a claim of) equality with the prophets; they supposed the saints to be like themselves. “Behold,” they said, “we are men, they are men; both we and they are in bondage to sleep and food.” In (their) blindness they did not perceive that there is an infinite difference between (them). Both species of zanbúr ate and drank from the (same) place, but from that one (the hornet) came a sting, and from this other (the bee) honey. Both species of deer ate grass and drank water: from this one came dung, and from that one pure musk.",1
"Both reeds drank from the same water-source, (but) this one is empty and that one (full of) sugar. Consider hundreds of thousands of such likenesses and observe that the distance between the two is (as great as) a seventy years' journey. This one eats, and filth is discharged from him; that one eats, and becomes entirely the light of God. This one eats, (and of him) is born nothing but avarice and envy; that one eats, (and of him) is born nothing but love of the One (God). This one is good (fertile) soil and that one brackish and bad; this one is a fair angel and that one a devil and wild beast.",1
"If both resemble each other in aspect, it may well be (so): bitter water and sweet water have (the same) clearness. Who knows (the difference) except a man possessed of (spiritual) taste? Find (him): he knows the sweet water from the brine. Comparing magic with (prophetic) miracle, he (the ignorant one) fancies that both are founded on deceit. The magicians (in the time) of Moses, for contention's sake, lifted up (in their hands) a rod like his, (But) between this rod and that rod there is a vast difference; from this action (magic) to that action (miracle) is a great way.",1
"This action is followed by the curse of God, (while) that action receives in payment the mercy (blessing) of God. The infidels in contending (for equality with the prophets and saints) have the nature of an ape: the (evil) nature is a canker within the breast. Whatever a man does, the ape at every moment does the same thing that he sees done by the man. He thinks, “I have acted like him”: how should that quarrelsome-looking one know the difference? This one (the holy man) acts by the command (of God), and he (the apish imitator) for the sake of quarrelling (rivalry). Pour dust on the heads of those who have quarrelsome faces!",1
"That (religious) hypocrite joins in ritual prayer with the (sincere) conformist (only) for quarrelling's sake, not for supplication. In prayer and fasting and pilgrimage and alms-giving the true believers are (engaged) with the hypocrite in (what brings) victory and defeat. Victory in the end is to the true believers; upon the hypocrite (falls) defeat in the state hereafter. Although both are intent on one game, in relation to each other they are (as far apart as) the man of Merv and the man of Rayy. Each one goes to his (proper) abiding-place; each one fares according to his name.",1
"If he be called a true believer, his soul rejoices; and if you say “hypocrite,” he becomes filled with fire (rage). His (the true believer's) name is loved on account of its essence (which is true faith); this one's (the hypocrite's) name is loathed on account of its pestilent qualities. (The four letters) mím and wáw and mím and nún do not confer honour: the word múmin (true believer) is only for the sake of denotation. If you call him (the true believer) hypocrite, this vile name is stinging (him) within like a scorpion. If this name is not derived from Hell, then why is there the taste of Hell in it?",1
"The foulness of that ill name is not from the letters; the bitterness of that sea-water is not from the vessel (containing it). The letters are the vessel: therein the meaning is (contained) like water; (but) the sea of the meaning is (with God)—with Himis the Ummu ’l-Kitáb. In this world the bitter sea and the sweet sea (are divided)— between them is a barrier which they do not seek to cross. Know that both these flow from one origin. Pass on from them both, go (all the way) to their origin! Without the touchstone you will never know in the assay adulterated gold and fine gold by (using your own) judgement.",1
"Any one in whose soul God shall put the touchstone, he will distinguish certainty from doubt. A piece of rubbish jumps into the mouth of a living man, and only when he ejects it is he at ease. When, amongst thousands of morsels (of food), one little piece of rubbish entered (his mouth), the living man's sense (of touch or taste) tracked it down. The worldly sense is the ladder to this world; the religious sense is the ladder to Heaven. Seek ye the well-being of the former sense from the physician; beg ye the well-being of the latter sense from the Beloved.",1
"The health of the former arises from the flourishing state of the body; the health of the latter arises from the ruin of the body. The spiritual way ruins the body and, after having ruined it, restores it to prosperity: Ruined the house for the sake of the golden treasure, and with that same treasure builds it better (than before); Cut off the water and cleansed the river-bed, then caused drinking-water to flow in the river-bed; Cleft the skin and drew out the iron point (of the arrow or spear)—then fresh skin grew over it (the wound);",1
"Rased the fortress and took it from the infidel, then reared thereon a hundred towers and ramparts. Who shall describe the action of Him who hath no like? This that I have said (is only what the present) necessity is affording. Sometimes it (the action of God) appears like this and sometimes the contrary of this: the work of religion is naught but bewilderment. (I mean) not one bewildered in such wise that his back is (turned) towards Him; nay, but one bewildered (with ecstasy) like this and drowned (in God) and intoxicated with the Beloved. The face of the one is set towards the Beloved, (while) the face of the other is just his own face (he is facing himself).",1
"Look long on the face of every one, keep watch attentively: it may be that by doing service (to Súfís) you will come to know the face (of the true saint). Since there is many a devil who hath the face of Adam, it is not well to give your hand to every hand, Because the fowler produces a whistling sound in order to decoy the bird, (So that) the bird may hear the note of its congener and come down from the air and find trap and knife-point.",1
"The work of (holy) men is (as) light and heat; the work of vile men is trickery and shamelessness. They make a woollen lion for the purpose of begging; they give the title of Ahmad (Mohammed) to Bú Musaylim; (But) to Bú Musaylim remained the title of Kadhdháb (Liar), to Mohammed remained (the title of) Ulu ’l-albáb (Endowed with understanding). The wine of God, its seal (last result) is pure musk, (but) as for (the other) wine, its seal is stench and torment Story of the Jewish king who for bigotry's sake used to slay the Christians. Amongst the Jews there was a king who wrought oppression, an enemy of Jesus and a destroyer of Christians.",1
"’Twas the epoch of Jesus and the turn was his: he was the soul of Moses, and Moses the soul of him; (But) the squint-eyed (double-seeing) king separated in the way of God those two Divine (prophets) who were (really) in accord (with each other). The master said to a squint-eyed (pupil), “Come on; go, fetch that bottle out of the room.” Said the squint-eyed one: “Which of the two bottles shall I bring to you? Explain fully.” “There are not two bottles,” replied the master; “go, leave off squinting and do not be seeing more (than one).”",2
"“O master,” said he, “don't chide me.” Said the master, “Smash one of those two.” The bottle was one, though in his eyes it seemed two; when he broke the bottle, there was no other. When one was broken, both vanished from sight: a man is made squint-eyed by (evil) propensity and anger. Anger and lust make a man squint-eyed, they change the spirit (so that it departs) from rectitude. When self-interest appears, virtue becomes hidden: a hundred veils rise from the heart to the eye.",2
"When the cadi lets bribery gain hold of his heart, how should he know the wronger from the wretched victim of wrong? The king, from Jewish rancour, became so squint-eyed that (we cry), “Mercy, O Lord, mercy (save us from such an affliction)!” He slew hundreds of thousands of wronged (innocent) believers, saying, “I am the protection and support of the religion of Moses.” How the vizier instructed the king to plot. He had a vizier, a miscreant and ogler (deceiver), who by reason of (his exceeding) guile would tie knots on water. “The Christians,” said he, “seek to save their lives; they hide their religion from the king.",2
"Slay them not, for slaying (them) is useless: religion hath no smell, it is not musk and aloes-wood. The secret is concealed in a hundred coverings: its outward form is (in agreement) with thee, resembling thee, (but) the inward (reality) is (in) disagreement.” The king said to him: “Tell (me), then, what is the (best) plan? What is the remedy against that deceit and imposture?— So that there may not remain a single Christian in the world, neither one whose religion is manifest nor one who is concealed.” “O king,” said he, “cut off my ears and hands, rip my nose by bitter (cruel) decree;",2
"Then bring me under the gallows, that an intercessor may plead for me. Do this deed in the place for (public) proclamation, on a highway where roads run in four directions. Then banish me from thy presence to a distant land, that I may cast mischief and confusion amongst them. How the vizier brought the Christians into doubt and perplexity. Then I will say (to them), ‘I am secretly a Christian. O God who knowest (all) things hidden, Thou knowest me. The king was informed of my (Christian) faith and from bigotry sought to take my life.",2
"I wished to hide my religion from the king and profess his religion, (But) the king got a scent of my inmost beliefs, and my words were suspected (when I stood) before the king. He said, “Your words are like a needle in bread (specious but pernicious); there is a window between my heart and yours. Through that window I have seen your (real) state: I see your state and will not heed your words.” Had not the spirit of Jesus been my aid, he would in Jewish fashion have torn me to pieces.",2
"For Jesus' sake I would yield my life and give my head and lay on myself (confess) myriads of obligations to him. I do not grudge Jesus my life, but full well am I versed in the knowledge of his religion. Grief was coming over me (it seemed to me a pity) that that holy religion should perish amongst those who are ignorant (of it). Thanks be to God and to Jesus that I have become a guide to the true faith. I have escaped from Jews and Judaism so (entirely) that I have bound my waist with a (Christian) girdle.",2
"The (present) epoch is the epoch of Jesus. O men, hearken with your souls unto the mysteries of his religion!’” The king did to him that deed (mutilation) which he had proposed: the people remained in amazement at his deed. He (the king) drove him away to the Christians. After that, he (the vizier) began to proselytise. How the Christians let themselves be duped by the vizier. Myriads of Christian men gathered round him, little by little, in his abode, (While) he secretly expounded to them the mysteries of Gospel and girdle and prayer. ",2
"Outwardly he was a preacher of (religious) ordinances, but inwardly he was (as) the whistle and snare (of the fowler). On this account some Companions (of Mohammed) begged of the Prophet (that he would acquaint them with) the deceitfulness of the ghoul-like soul, Saying, “What of hidden selfish interests does it mingle in acts of worship and in pure spiritual devotion?” They were not seeking from him excellence of piety; they were not inquiring where lay the outward defect. Hair by hair, speck by speck, they were recognising the deceitfulness of the fleshly soul as (plainly as the difference of) the rose from parsley.",2
"Even the hair-splitters (the most scrupulous) of the Companions used to become distraught in spirit at the (Prophet's) admonition to them (the inquirers). How the Christians followed the vizier. The Christians all gave their hearts to him: what (how great), indeed, is the strength of the (blind) conformity of the vulgar! They planted love of him within their breasts, they were regarding him as the vicar of Jesus. He inwardly (in reality) was the accursed one-eyed Antichrist. O God, do Thou (hear and) answer the cry (of those in trouble) —what a good helper art Thou! O God, there are myriads of snares and baits, and we are as greedy foodless birds.",2
"From moment to moment we are caught in a fresh snare, though we become, each one, (like) a falcon or a Símurgh. Every moment Thou art delivering us, and again we are going to a snare, O Thou who art without want! We are putting corn in this barn, (and then) we are losing the corn that has been garnered. (Why), after all, do not we consider with intelligent mind that this damage to the corn arises from the deceitfulness of the mouse? Since the mouse has made a hole in our barn, and our barn has been ravaged by its guile,",2
"O soul, in the first place avert the mischief of the mouse, and then show fervour (zeal) in garnering the corn. Hear (one) of the sayings related from the Chiefest of the Chief (the Prophet): “No prayer is complete without ‘presence’ (concentration of the mind on God).” If there is no thievish mouse in our barn, where is the corn of forty years' works (of devotion)? Why is the daily sincerity (of our devotions) not being stored, bit by bit, in this barn of ours? Many a star (spark) of fire shot forth from the iron (of good works), and that burning heart received (it) and drew (it) in;",2
"But in the darkness a hidden thief is laying his finger upon the stars, Extinguishing the stars one by one, that no lamp may shine from the (spiritual) sky. Though there be thousands of snares at our feet, when Thou art with us there is not any trouble. Every night Thou freest the spirits from the body's snare, and dost erase (the impressions on) the tablets (of the mind). The spirits are set free every night from this cage, (they are) done with ordinance and talk and tale.",2
"At night prisoners are unconscious of their prison, at night governors are unconscious of their power. There is no sorrow, no thought of gain or loss, no fancy of this person or that person. This is the state of the ‘árif (gnostic), even without sleep: God said, (Thou wouldst deem them awake) whilst they slept. Shy not at this. He is asleep, day and night, to the affairs of the world, like a pen in the hand of the Lord's control. One who sees not the hand in the writing thinks (that) the act (of writing proceeds) from the pen by means of movement.",2
"He (God) hath shown forth some part of this state of the ‘árif, (inasmuch as) the vulgar too are carried off (overtaken) by sleep of the senses. Their souls are gone into the desert that is without description: their spirits and bodies are at rest; And with a whistle thou leadest them back to the snare, leadest them all (back) to justice and to the judge. Like Isráfíl (Seraphiel), He (God) who causes the dawn to break brings them all from those lands (of spirit) into (the world of) form. He embodies the spirits divested (of body), He makes each body pregnant (laden) again (with actions and works).",2
"He makes the steed of the souls bare of saddle: this is the inner meaning of “Sleep is the brother of Death”; But in order that they may return in the daytime, He puts a long tether on its leg, So that in the daytime He may lead it back from that meadow and bring it from the pasture (to go) under the load. Would that He had guarded this spirit as the Men of the Cave or as the Ark of Noah, That this mind and eye and ear might be delivered from the Flood of wakefulness and consciousness!",2
"Oh, in the world there is many a Man of the Cave beside you, before you, at this time: The Cave is with him, the Friend is in converse with him; but your eyes and ears are sealed, (so) what does it avail? Story of the Caliph's seeing Laylá. The Caliph said to Laylá: “Art thou she by whom Majnún was distracted and led astray? Thou art not superior to other fair ones.” “Be silent,” she replied, “since thou art not Majnún.” Whosoever is awake (to the material world) is the more asleep (to the spiritual world); his wakefulness is worse than his sleep.",2
"When our soul is not awake to God, wakefulness is like closing our doors (to Divine influences). All day long, from the buffets of phantasy and from (thoughts of) loss and gain and from fear of decline, There remains to it (the soul) neither joy nor grace and glory nor way of journeying to Heaven. The one asleep (to spiritual things) is he who hath hope of every vain fancy and holds parley with it. Diabolum per somnum videt tanquam virginem caelestem, deinde propter libidinem effundit cum diabolo aquam (seminis).",2
"Postquam semen generationis in terram salsuginosam infudit, ipse ad se rediit, fugit ab eo illa imago. Hinc percipit languorem capitis et (videt) corpus pollutum. Proh dolor ob illud simulacrum visum (sed revera) non visum! The bird is flying on high, and its shadow is speeding on the earth, flying like a bird: Some fool begins to chase the shadow, running (after it) so far that he becomes powerless (exhausted), Not knowing that it is the reflexion of that bird in the air, not knowing where is the origin of the shadow.",2
"He shoots arrows at the shadow; his quiver is emptied in seeking (to shoot it): The quiver of his life became empty: his life passed in running hotly in chase of the shadow. (But) when the shadow of God is his nurse, it delivers him from (every) phantom and shadow. The shadow of God is that servant of God who is dead to this world and living through God. Lay hold of his skirt most quickly without misgiving, that you may be saved in the skirt (end) of the last days (of the world).",2
"(The shadow mentioned in the words) How He (God) extended the shadow is the form of the saints, which guides to the light of the Divine Sun. Do not go in this valley without this guide; say, like Khalíl (Abraham), “I love not them that set.” Go, from the shadow gain a sun: pluck the skirt of the (spiritual) king, Shams-i Tabrízí (the Sun of Tabríz)! If you do not know the way to this feast and bridal, ask of Ziyá’u ’l-Haqq (the Radiance of God) Husámu’ddín. And if on the way envy seize you by the throat, it belongs to (is characteristic of) Iblís to go beyond bounds in envy;",2
"For he because of envy hath disdain for Adam, and because of envy is at war with felicity. In the Way there is no harder pass than this. Oh, fortunate he who is not companioned by envy! This body, you must know, is the house of envy, for the household are tainted with envy. If the body is the house of envy, yet God made that body very pure. (The text) Cleanse My house, ye twain, is the explanation of (such) purity: it (the purified heart) is a treasure of (Divine) light, though its talisman is of earth.",2
"When you practise deceit and envy against one who is without envy, from that envy black stain arise in your heart. Become (as) dust under the feet of the men of God; throw dust on the head of envy, even as we do. Explanation of the envy of the vizier. That petty vizier had his origin from envy, so that for vanity he gave to the wind (sacrificed) his ears and nose, In the hope that by the sting of envy his venom might enter the souls of the poor (Christians). Any one who from envy mutilates his nose makes himself without ear and without nose (unable to apprehend spiritual things).",2
"The nose is that which catches a scent, and which the scent leads towards an abode (of spiritual truth). Whoever hath no scent is without a nose; the scent (referred to) is that scent which is religious. When he has caught a scent and given no thanks for it, (that) ingratitude comes and devours his nose (deprives him of the organ of spiritual perception). Give thanks (to God) and be a slave to those who give thanks: be in their presence (as one) dead, be steadfast. Do not, like the vizier, make brigandage your stock-in-trade; do not turn the people away from the ritual prayer.",2
"The miscreant vizier had become (in appearance) a true religious counsellor, (but) he had craftily put garlic in the almond cake. How the sagacious among the Christians perceived the guile of the vizier. Whoever was possessed of (spiritual) discernment was feeling a sweet savour in his words and, joined therewith, bitterness. He (the vizier) was saying fine things mixed (with foul): he had poured some poison into the sugared julep. The outward sense of it was saying, “Be diligent in the Way,” but in effect it was saying to the soul, “Be slack.” If the surface of silver is white and new, (yet) the hands and dress are blackened by it.",2
"Although fire is red-faced (bright and glorious) with sparks, look at the black behaviour (displayed) in its action. If the lightning appears luminous to the eye, (yet) from its distinctive property it is the robber of sight (it strikes men blind). (As for) any (Christian) who was not wary and possessed of discernment, the words of him (the vizier) were (as) a collar on his neck. During six years, in separation from the king, the vizier became a refuge for the followers of Jesus. To him the people wholly surrendered their religion and their hearts: at his command and decree they were ready to die. How the king sent messages in secret to the vizier.",2
"Messages (passed) between the king and him: the king had words of comfort from him in secret. The king wrote to him, saying, “O my fortunate one, the time is come: quickly set my mind at ease.” He replied: “Behold, O king, I am preparing to cast disorders into the religion of Jesus.” Explanation of the twelve tribes of the Christians. The people of Jesus had twelve amírs as rulers in authority over them. Each party followed one amír and had become devoted to its own amír from desire (of worldly gain).",2
"These twelve amírs and their followers became the slaves of that vizier of evil sign. They all put trust in his words, they all took his procedure as a pattern. Each amír would have given up his life in his presence at the time and hour (on the spot), if he (the vizier) had bidden him die. How the vizier confused the ordinances of the Gospel. He prepared a scroll in the name of (addressed to) each one, the (written) form of each scroll (of) a different tenor, The ordinances of each (of) a diverse kind, this contradicting that from the end to the beginning.",2
"In one he made the path of asceticism and hunger to be the basis of repentance and the condition (necessary) for conversion. In one he said: “Asceticism profits naught: in this Way there is no place (means) of deliverance but generosity.” In one he said: “Your hunger and generosity are (imply) association on your part (of other objects) with (Him who is) the object of your worship. Excepting trust (in God) and complete resignation in sorrow and joy, all is a deceit and snare.” In one he said: “It is incumbent (on you) to serve (God); else the thought of putting trust (in Him) is (a cause of) suspicion.”",2
"In one he said: “There are (Divine) commands and prohibitions, (but they) are not for practice (observance): they are (only) to show our weakness (inability to fulfil them), So that we may behold our weakness therein and at that time recognise the power of God.” In one he said: “Do not regard your weakness: that weakness is an act of ingratitude. Beware! Regard your power, for this power is from Him: know that your power is the gift of Him who is Hú (the Absolute God).” In one he said: “Leave both these (qualities) behind: whatsoever is contained in sight (regard for other than God) is an idol (something which involves dualism).”",2
"In one he said: “Do not put out this candle (of sight), for this sight is as a candle (lighting the way) to (interior) concentration. When you relinquish sight and phantasy (too soon), you will have put out the candle of union at midnight.” In one he said: “Put it out—have no fear—that you may see myriads of sights in exchange; For by putting it out the candle of the spirit is increased: by your self-denial your Laylá (beloved) becomes your Majnún (lover). If any one abandons the world by his own (act of) renunciation, the world comes to him (with homage) more and more.”",2
"In one he said: “That which God hath given you He made sweet to you in (at the time of) bringing it into existence. He made it easy (blessed) to you, and do you take it gladly: do not throw yourself into anguish.” In one he said: “Let go all that belongs to self, for it is wrong and bad to comply with your nature.” (Many) different roads have become easy (to follow): every one's religion has become (to him) as (dear) as life. If God's making (religion) easy were the (right) road, every Jew and Zoroastrian would have knowledge of Him.",2
"In one he said: “That (alone) is made easy (blessed) that (nothing but) spiritual food should be the life of the heart.” When the enjoyments of the (sensual) nature are past, like brackish soil they raise no produce and crop. The produce thereof is naught but penitence; the sale thereof yields only loss, nothing more. That is not “easy” in the end; its (true) name ultimately is “hard.” Distinguish the hard from the easy: consider (what is) the goodliness of this and that in the end.",2
"In one he said: “Seek a master (teacher): you will not find foresight as to the end among the qualities derived from ancestors.” Every sort of religious sect foresaw the end (according to their own surmise): of necessity they fell captive to error. To foresee the end is not (as simple as) a hand-loom; otherwise, how would there have been difference in religions? In one he said: “You are the master, because you know the master. Be a man and be not subject to men. Go, take your own head (choose your own way), and be not one whose head is turning (bewildered in search of a guide).”",2
"In one he said: “All this (multiplicity) is one: whoever sees two is a squint-eyed manikin.” In one he said: “How should a hundred be one? He who thinks this is surely mad.” The doctrines, every one, are contrary to each other: how should they be one? Are poison and sugar one? Until you pass beyond (the difference of) poison and sugar, how will you catch a scent of unity and oneness? Twelve books of this style and fashion were drawn up in writing by that enemy to the religion of Jesus. Showing how this difference lies in the form of the doctrine, not in the real nature of the Way.",2
"He had no scent (perception) of the unicolority of Jesus, nor had he a disposition from (imbued with) the tincture of the dyeing-vat of Jesus. From that pure vat a garment of a hundred colours would become as simple and one coloured as light. (This) is not the unicolority from which weariness ensues; nay, it is (a case) like (that of) fishes and clear water:Although there are thousands of colours on dry land, (yet) fishes are at war with dryness. Who is the fish and what is the sea in (my) simile, that the King Almighty and Glorious should resemble them?",2
"In (the world of) existence myriads of seas and fishes prostrate themselves in adoration before that Munificence and Bounty. How many a rain of largesse hath rained, so that the sea was made thereby to scatter pearls! How many a sun of generosity hath shone, so that cloud and sea learned to be bountiful! The sunbeams of Wisdom struck on soil and clay, so that the earth became receptive of the seed. The soil is faithful to its trust, and whatever you have sown in it, you carry away the (equivalent in) kind thereof without fraud (on the part of the soil).",2
"It has derived this faithfulness from that (Divine) faithfulness, inasmuch as the sun of Justice has shone upon it. Until springtide brings the token of God, the soil does not reveal its secrets. The Bounteous One who gave to an inanimate thing these informations and this faithfulness and this righteousness, His grace makes an inanimate thing informed, (while) His wrath makes blind the men of understanding. Soul and heart cannot endure that ferment: to whom shall I speak? There is not in the world a single ear (capable of apprehension).",2
"Wherever there was an ear, through Him it became an eye; wherever there was a stone, through Him it became a jasper. He is an alchemist—what is alchemy (compared with His action)? He is a giver of miracles (to prophets)—what is magic (compared with these miracles)? This uttering of praise (to Him) is (really) the omission of praise on my part, for this (praise) is a proof of (my) being, and being is a sin. It behoves (us) to be not-being in the presence of His Being: in His presence what is (our) being? Blind and blue. Were it not blind it would have been melted (consumed) by Him: it would have known the heat of (the Divine) sun;",2
"And were it not blue from mourning, how would this region (of phenomenal existence) have (remained) frozen like ice? Setting forth how the vizier incurred perdition (by engaging) in this plot. The vizier was ignorant and heedless, like the (Jewish) king: he was wrestling with the eternal and inevitable, With a God so mighty that in a moment He causes a hundred worlds like ours to come into existence from non-existence: A hundred worlds like ours He displays to the sight, when He makes your eye seeing by (the light of) Himself. If the world appears to you vast and bottomless, know that to Omnipotence it is not (so much as) an atom.",2
"This world, indeed, is the prison of your souls: oh, go in yonder direction, for there lies your open country. This world is finite, and truly that (other) is infinite: image and form are a barrier to that Reality. The myriads of Pharaoh's lances were shattered by (the hand of) Moses (armed) with a single staff. Myriads were the therapeutic arts of Galen: before Jesus and his (life-giving) breath they were a laughing-stock. Myriads were the books of (pre-Islamic) poems: at the word of an illiterate (prophet) they were (put to) shame.",2
"(Confronted) with such an all-conquering Lord, how should any one not die (to self), unless he be a vile wretch? Many a mind (strong and firm) as a mountain did He uproot; the cunning bird He hung up by its two feet. To sharpen the intelligence and wits is not the (right) way: none but the broken (in spirit) wins the favour of the King. Oh, many the amassers of treasure, digging holes (in search of treasure), who became an ox's beard (dupe) to that vain schemer (the vizier)! Who is the ox that you should become his beard? What is earth that you should become its stubble?",2
"When a woman became pale-faced (ashamed) of (her) wickedness, God metamorphosed her and made her Zuhra (the planet Venus). To make a woman Zuhra was metamorphosis: what (then) is it to become earth and clay, O contumacious one? Your spirit was bearing you towards the highest sphere (of heaven): you went towards the water and the clay amongst the lowest (of the low). By this fall you metamorphosed yourself from that (state of) existence which was the envy of the (spiritual) intelligences. Consider, then, how is (what is the character of) this metamorphosis: compared with that metamorphosis (of the woman) this (which you have suffered) is exceedingly vile.",2
"You urged the steed of ambition towards the stars: you did not acknowledge Adam who was worshipped (by the angels). After all, you are a son of Adam. O degenerate! how long will you regard lowness as nobility? How long will you say, “I will conquer a whole world, I will make this world full of myself”? If the world should be filled with snow from end to end, the glow of the sun would melt it with a single look. God by a single spark (of His mercy) maketh naught his (the vizier's) burden (of sin) and (the burden) of a hundred viziers and a hundred thousand.",2
"He maketh the essence of that (false) imagination to be wisdom; He maketh the essence of that poisoned water to be a (wholesome) drink. That which raises doubt He turneth into certainty; He maketh loving kindnesses grow from the causes of hatred. He cherisheth Abraham in the fire; He turneth fear into security of spirit. By His burning (destroying) of secondary causes I am distraught; in (my) fancies of Him I am like a sophist (sceptic or agnostic). How the vizier started another plan to mislead the (Christian) folk. The vizier formed in his mind another plan: he abandoned preaching and sat alone in seclusion.",2
"He inspired ardour in his disciples from (their) longing (to see him); he remained in seclusion forty or fifty days. The people became mad from longing for him and on account of being separated from his (spiritual) feeling and discourse and intuition. They were making supplication and lament, while he in solitude was bent double by austerities. They said, “Without thee we have no light: how (what) is the state of a blind man without a leader? By way of showing favour (to us) and for God's sake, do not keep us parted from thee any longer.",2
"We are as children and thou art our nurse: do thou spread over us that shadow (of thy protection).” He said, “My soul is not far from them that love (me), but there is no permission to come forth.” Those amírs came for intercession, and the disciples came in reproach,Saying, “O noble sir, what a misfortune is this for us! Without thee we are left orphaned (deprived) of our hearts and our religion. Thou art making a pretence while we in grief are heaving cold (fruitless) sighs from the burning heat of our hearts.",2
"We have become accustomed to thy sweet discourse, we have drunk of the milk of thy wisdom. Allah! Allah! do not thou (O vizier) treat us with such cruelty: show kindness to-day, do not (put off till) to-morrow. Does thy heart give to thee (consent) that these who have lost their hearts (to thee) should at last, being without thee, become (numbered) amongst them that have nothing left? They all are writhing like fishes on dry land: let loose the water, remove the dam from the stream. O thou like whom there is none in the world, for God's sake, for God's sake, come to the aid of thy people!” How the vizier refused the request of the disciples.",2
"He said: “Beware, O ye enslaved by words and talk, ye who seek admonition (consisting) of the speech of the tongue and (the hearing) of the ear. Put cotton-wool in the ear of the low (physical) sense, take off the bandage of (that) sense from your eyes! The ear of the head is the cotton-wool of the ear of the conscience: until the former becomes deaf, that inward (ear) is deaf. Become without sense and without ear and without thought, that ye may hear the call (of God to the soul), ‘Return!’” So long as thou art (engaged) in the conversation of wakefulness, how wilt thou catch any scent of the conversation of sleep?",2
"Our speech and action is the exterior journey: the interior journey is above the sky. The (physical) sense saw (only) dryness, because it was born of dryness (earth): the Jesus of the spirit set foot on the sea. The journey of the dry body befell on dry land, (but) the journey of the spirit set foot (took place) in the heart of the sea. Since thy life has passed in travelling on land, now mountain, now river, now desert, Whence wilt thou gain the Water of Life? Where wilt thou cleave the waves of the Sea?",2
"The waves of earth are our imagination and understanding and thought; the waves of water are (mystical) self- effacement and intoxication and death (faná). Whilst thou art in this (sensual) intoxication, thou art far from that (mystical) intoxication; whilst thou art drunken with this, thou art blind to that cup. Outward speech and talk is as dust: do thou for a time make a habit of silence. Take heed! How the disciples repeated their request that he should interrupt his seclusion. They all said: “O sage who seekest a crevice (means of evasion), say not to us this (word of) guile and harshness. Lay on the beast a burden in proportion to its endurance, lay on the weak a task in proportion to their strength.",2
"The bait for every bird is according to its (the bird's) measure (capacity): how should a fig be the food (lure) for every bird? If you give a babe bread instead of milk, take it (for granted) that the poor babe will die of the bread; (Yet) afterwards, when it grows teeth, that babe will of its own accord ask for bread. When an unfledged bird begins to fly, it becomes a mouthful for any rapacious cat; (But) when it grows wings, it will fly of itself without trouble and without whistling (prompting), good or bad.",2
"Thy speech makes the Devil silent, thy words make our ears (full of) intelligence. Our ears are (full of) intelligence when thou art speaking; our dry land is a river when thou art the ocean. With thee, earth is better to us than heaven, O thou by whom (the world from) Arcturus to the Fish is illumined! Without thee, darkness is over heaven for us, (but) compared with thee, O Moon, who is this heaven at all? The heavens have the form of sublimity, (but) the essence of sublimity belongs to the pure spirit.",2
"The form of sublimity is for bodies; beside the essence (reality) bodies are (mere) names.” The refusal of the vizier to interrupt his seclusion. He said: “Cut short your arguments, let my advice make its way into your souls and hearts. If I am trustworthy, the trustworthy is not doubted, even though I should call heaven earth. If I am (endowed with) perfection, why (this) disbelief in my perfection? and if I am not (perfect), why this molestation and annoyance? I will not go forth from this seclusion, because I am occupied with inward experiences.” How the disciples raised objections against the vizier's secluding himself.",2
"They all said: “O vizier, it is not disbelief: our words are not as the words of strangers. The tears of our eyes are running because of our separation from thee; sigh after sigh is going (up) from the midst of our souls. A babe does not contend with its nurse, but it weeps, although it knows neither evil nor good. We are as the harp and thou art striking (it with) the plectrum (playing on it): the lamentation is not from us, it is thou that art making lamentation. We are as the flute, and the music in us is from thee; we are as the mountain, and the echo in us is from thee.",2
"We are as pieces of chess (engaged) in victory and defeat: our victory and defeat is from thee, O thou whose qualities are comely! Who are we, O thou soul of our souls, that we should remain in being beside thee? We and our existences are (really) non-existences: thou art the absolute Being which manifests the perishable (causes phenomena to appear). We all are lions, but lions on a banner: because of the wind they are rushing onward from moment to moment. Their onward rush is visible, and the wind is unseen: may that which is unseen not fail from us!",2
"Our wind (that whereby we are moved) and our being are of thy gift; our whole existence is from thy bringing (us) into being. Thou didst show the delightfulness of Being unto not-being, (after) thou hadst caused not-being to fall in love with thee. Take not away the delightfulness of thy bounty; take not away thy dessert and wine and wine-cup! And if thou take it away, who is there that will make inquiry? How should the picture strive with the painter? Do not look on us, do not fix thy gaze on us: look on thine own kindness and generosity.",2
"We were not, and there was no demand on our part, (yet) thy grace was hearkening to our unspoken prayer (and calling us into existence).” Before the painter and the brush the picture is helpless and bound like a child in the womb. Before Omnipotence all the people of the (Divine) court of audience (the world) are as helpless as the (embroiderer's) fabric before the needle. Now He makes the picture thereon (one of) the Devil, now (of) Adam; now He makes the picture thereon (one of) joy, now (one of) grief. There is no power (to any one) that he should move a hand in defence; no (right of) speech, that he should utter a word concerning injury or benefit.",2
"Recite from the Qur’án the interpretation of (i.e. a text which interprets) the (preceding) verse: God said, Thou didst not throw when thou threwest. If we let fly an arrow, that (action) is not from us: we are (only) the bow, and the shooter of the arrow is God. This is not jabr (compulsion); it is the meaning of jabbárí (almightiness): the mention of almightiness is for the sake of (inspiring us with) humility. Our humility is evidence of necessity, (but) our sense of guilt is evidence of freewill. If there were not freewill, what is this shame? And what is this sorrow and guilty confusion and abashment?",2
"Why is there chiding between masters and pupils? Why is the mind changing (so as to depart) from plans (already formed)? And if you say that he (the assertor of freewill) takes no heed of His (God's) compulsion, (and that) God's moon has become hidden in His cloud, There is a good answer to this; if you hearken, you will relinquish unbelief and incline towards the (true) religion. Remorse and humility occur at the time of illness: the time of illness is wholly wakefulness (of conscience). At the time when you are becoming ill, you pray God to forgive your trespass;",2
"The foulness of your sin is shown to you, you resolve to come back to the (right) way; You make promises and vows that henceforth your chosen course (of action) will be nothing but obedience (to God): Therefore it has become certain that illness gives to you conscience and wakefulness. Note, then, this principle, O thou that seekest the principle; every one who suffers pain has caught the scent (thereof): The more wakeful any one is, the more full of suffering he is; the more aware (of God) he is, the paler he is in countenance.",2
"If you are aware of His jabr (compulsion), where is your humility? Where is your feeling of (being loaded with) the chain of His jabbárí (almightiness)? How should one make merry who is bound in chains? When does the captive in prison behave like the man who is free? And if you consider that your foot is shackled (and that) the king's officers are sitting (as custodians) over you, Then do not act like an officer (tyrannously) towards the helpless, inasmuch as that is not the nature and habit of a helpless man. Since you do not feel His compulsion, do not say (that you are compelled); and if you feel it, where is the sign of your feeling?",2
"In every act for which you have inclination, you are clearly conscious of your power (to perform it), (But) in every act for which you have no inclination and desire, in regard to that (act) you have become a necessitarian, saying, “This is from God.” The prophets are necessitarians in regard to the works of this world, (while) the infidels are necessitarians in regard to the works of the next world. To the prophets the works of the next world are (a matter of) freewill; to the foolish the works of this world are (a matter of) freewill,Because every bird flies to its own congener: it (follows) behind, and its spirit (goes) before, (leading it on).",2
"Inasmuch as the infidels were congeners of Sijjn (Hell), they were well-disposed to the prison (sijn) of this world. Inasmuch as the prophets were congeners of ‘Illiyyín (Heaven), they went towards the ‘Illiyyín of spirit and heart. This discourse hath no end, but let us (now) relate the story to its completion. How the vizier made the disciples lose hope of his abandoning seclusion. The vizier cried out from within, “O disciples, be this made known to you from me, That Jesus hath given me a such-like message: ‘Be separated from all friends and kinsfolk.",2
"Set thy face to the wall, sit alone, and choose to be secluded even from thine own existence.’ After this there is no permission (for me) to speak; after this I have nothing to do with talk. Farewell, O friends! I am dead: I have carried my belongings up to the Fourth Heaven, In order that beneath the fiery sphere I may not burn like firewood in woe and perdition, (But) henceforth may sit beside Jesus at the top of the Fourth Heaven.” How the vizier appointed each one of the amírs separately as his successor.",2
"And then he summoned those amírs one by one and conversed with each (of them) alone. He said to each one, “In the religion of Jesus thou art the vicar of God and my khalífa (vicegerent), And those other amírs are thy followers: Jesus hath made all of them thy assistants. Any amír who lifts his neck (in rebellion), seize him and either kill him or hold him captive; But do not declare this whilst I am alive: do not seek this supreme authority until I am dead.",2
"Until I am dead, do not reveal this: do not lay claim to sovereignty and dominion. Here is this scroll and the ordinances of the Messiah: recite them distinctly, one by one, to his people.” Thus he spoke to each amír separately, (saying), “There is no vicar in the religion of God except thee.” He honoured each, one by one, (in this way): whatever he said to that (amír) he also said to this. To each he gave one scroll: every one was purposely the contrary of the other.",2
"All the scrolls were different, like the forms of the letters (of the alphabet) from yá to alif. The rule (laid down) in this scroll was contrary to the rule in that: we have already explained (the nature of) this contradiction. How the vizier killed himself in seclusion. After that, he shut the door for other forty days (and then) killed himself and escaped from his existence. When the people learned of his death, there came to pass at his grave the scene of the Resurrection. So great a multitude gathered at his grave, tearing their hair, rending their garments in wild grief for him,",2
"That only God can reckon the number of them—Arabs and Turks and Greeks and Kurds. They put his (grave's) earth on their heads; they deemed anguish for him to be the remedy for themselves. During a month those multitudes over his grave made a way for blood from their eyes (shed tears of anguish). How the people of Jesus—on him be peace!—asked the amírs, “Which one of you is the successor?” After a month the people said, “O chiefs, which of (the) amírs is designated in his place, That we may acknowledge him as our religious leader instead of him (the vizier), and give our hands and skirts into his hand?",2
"Since the sun is gone and has branded us (left the brand of sorrow in our hearts), is not a lamp the (only) resource in his stead? Since union with the beloved has vanished from before our eyes, we must needs have a vicar as a memorial of him (i.e. one who will recall him to our memory). Since the rose is past and the garden ravaged, from whom shall we get the perfume of the rose? From rosewater.” Inasmuch as God comes not into sight, these prophets are the vicars of God. Nay, I have said (this) wrongly; for if you suppose that the vicar and He who is represented by the vicar are two, it (such a thought) is bad, not good.",2
"Nay; they are two so long as you are a worshipper of form, (but) they have become one to him who has escaped from (consciousness of) form. When you look at the form, your eye is two; look at its (the eye's) light, which grew from the eye. ’Tis impossible to distinguish the light of the two eyes, when a man has cast his look upon their light. If ten lamps are present in (one) place, each differs in form from another: To distinguish without any doubt the light of each, when you turn your face towards their light, is impossible.",2
"If you count a hundred apples or a hundred quinces, they do not remain a hundred (but) become one, when you crush them (together). In things spiritual there is no division and no numbers; in things spiritual there is no partition and no individuals. Sweet is the oneness of the Friend with His friends: catch (and cling to) the foot of spirit. Form is headstrong. Make headstrong form waste away with tribulation, that beneath it you may descry unity, like a (buried) treasure; And if you waste it not away, His favours will waste it—oh, my heart is His vassal.",2
"He even showeth Himself to (our) hearts, He seweth the tattered frock of the dervish. Simple were we and all one substance; we were all without head and without foot yonder. We were one substance, like the Sun; we were knotless and pure, like water. When that goodly Light took form, it became (many in) number like the shadows of a battlement. Rase ye the battlement with the manjaníq (mangonel), that difference may vanish from amidst this company (of shadows).",2
"I would have explained this (matter) with (eager) contention, but I fear lest some (weak) mind may stumble. The points (involved in it) are sharp as a sword of steel; if you have not the shield (of capacity to understand), turn back and flee! Do not come without shield against this adamant (keen blade), for the sword is not ashamed of cutting. For this cause I have put the sword in sheath, that none who misreads may read contrariwise (in a sense contrary to the true meaning of my words). We come (now) to complete the tale and (speak) of the loyalty of the multitude of the righteous,",2
"Who rose up after (the death of) this leader, demanding a vicar in his place. The quarrel of the amírs concerning the succession. One of those amírs advanced and went before that loyal-minded people. “Behold,” said he, “I am that man's vicar: I am the vicar of Jesus at the present time. Look, this scroll is my proof that after him the vicarate belongs to me.” Another amír came forth from ambush: his pretension regarding the vicegerency was the same;",2
"He too produced a scroll from under his arm, so that in both (amírs) there arose the Jewish anger. The rest of the amírs, one after another, drawing swords of keen mettle, Each with a sword and a scroll in his hand, fell to combat like raging elephants. Hundreds of thousands of Christians were slain, so that there were mounds of severed heads; Blood flowed, on left and right, like a torrent; mountains of this dust (of battle) rose in the air.",2
"The seeds of dissension which he (the vizier) had sown had become a calamity (cause of destruction) to their heads. The walnuts (bodies) were broken, and those which had the kernel had, after being slain, a spirit pure and fair. Slaughter and death which befalls the bodily frame is like breaking pomegranates and apples: That which is sweet becomes pomegranate-syrup, and that which is rotten is naught but noise: That which has reality is made manifest (after death), and that which is rotten is put to shame.",2
"Go, strive after reality, O worshipper of form, inasmuch as reality is the wing on form's body. Consort with the followers of reality, that you may both win the gift and be generous (in giving yourself up to God). Beyond dispute, in this body the spirit devoid of reality is even as a wooden sword in the sheath: Whilst it remains in the sheath, it is (apparently) valuable, (but) when it has come forth it is an implement (only fit) for burning. Do not take a wooden sword into the battle! First see (whether your sword is a real one), in order that your plight may not be wretched.",2
"If it is made of wood, go, seek another; and if it is adamant, march forward joyously. The sword (of reality) is in the armoury of the saints: to see (and associate with) them is for you (as precious as) the Elixir. All the wise have said this same thing: the wise man is a (Divine) mercy to created beings. If you would buy a pomegranate, buy (it when it is) laughing (having its rind cleft open), so that its laughter (openness) may give information as to its seeds. Oh, blessed is its laughter, for through its mouth it shows the heart, like a pearl from the casket of the spirit.",2
"Unblest was the laughter (openness) of the red anemone, from whose mouth appeared the blackness of its heart. The laughing pomegranate makes the garden laughing (gay and blooming): companionship with (holy) men makes you one of the (holy) men. Though you be rock or marble, you will become a jewel when you reach the man of heart (the saint). Plant the love of the holy ones within your spirit; do not give your heart (to aught) save to the love of them whose hearts are glad. Go not to the neighbourhood of despair: there are hopes. Go not in the direction of darkness: there are suns.",2
"The heart leads you into the neighbourhood of the men of heart (the saints); the body leads you into the prison of water and earth. Oh, give your heart food from (conversation with) one who is in accord with it; go, seek (spiritual) advancement from one who is advanced. How honour was paid to the description of Mustafá (Mohammed), on whom be peace, which was mentioned in the Gospel. The name of Mustafá was in the Gospel—(Mustafá) the chief of the prophets, the sea of purity. There was mention of his (external) characteristics and appearance; there was mention of his warring and fasting and eating. A party among the Christians, for the sake of the Divine reward, whenever (in reading the Gospel) they came to that name and discourse,",2
"Would bestow kisses on that noble name and stoop their faces towards that beauteous description. In this tribulation of which we have told, that party were secure from tribulation and dread, Secure from the mischief of the amírs and the vizier, seeking refuge in the protection of the Name of Ahmad (Mohammed). Their offspring also multiplied: the Light of Ahmad aided and befriended them. And the other party among the Christians (who) were holding the Name of Ahmad in contempt,",2
"They became contemptible and despised through dissensions caused by the evil counselling and evil-plotting vizier; Moreover, their religion and their law became corrupted in consequence of the scrolls which set forth all perversely. The Name of Ahmad gives such help as this, so that (one may judge) how his Light keeps guard (over his followers). Since the Name of Ahmad became (to the Christians) an impregnable fortress, what then must be the Essence of that trusted Spirit? After this irremediable bloodshed which befell through the affliction (brought upon the Christians) by the vizier, The story of another Jewish king who endeavoured to destroy the religion of Jesus.",2
"Another king, of the progeny of that Jew, addressed himself to the destruction of the people of Jesus. If you desire information about this second outbreak, read the chapter of the Qur’án (beginning): By Heaven which hath the(zodiacal) signs. This second king set foot in the evil way that was originated by the former king. Whosoever establishes an evil way (practice), towards him goes malediction every hour. The righteous departed and their ways remained, and from the vile there remained (nothing but) injustice and execrations.",3
"Until the Resurrection, the face of every congener of those wicked men who comes into existence is turned towards that one (who belongs to his own kind). Vein by vein is this sweet water and bitter water, flowing in (God's) creatures until the blast of the trumpet (at the Resurrection). To the righteous is the inheritance of the sweet water. What is that inheritance? We have caused (those of Our servants whom We have chosen) to inherit the Book. If you will consider, the supplications of the seekers (of God) are rays (proceeding) from the substance of prophethood. The rays are circling with the substances (whence they spring): the ray goes (ultimately) in the direction where that (substance) is.",3
"The window-gleam runs round the house, because the sun goes from sign to sign of the zodiac. Any one who has affinity with a star (planet) has a concurrence (of qualities) with his star. If his ascendant star be Venus, his whole inclination and love and desire is for joy; And if he be one born under Mars, one whose nature is to shed blood, he seeks war and malignity and enmity. Beyond the (material) stars are stars in which is no conflagration or sinister aspect,",3
"(Stars) moving in other heavens, not these seven heavens known to all, (Stars) immanent in the radiance of the light of God, neither joined to each other nor separate from each other. When any one's ascendant (fortune) is (from) those stars, his soul burns the infidels in driving (them) off. His anger is not (like) the anger of the man born under Mars —perverse, and of such nature that it is (now) dominant and (now) dominated. The dominant light (of the saints) is secure from defect and dimness between the two fingers of the Light of God.",3
"God hath scattered that light over (all) spirits, (but only) the fortunate have held up their skirts (to receive it); And he (that is fortunate), having gained that strown largesse of light, has turned his face away from all except God. Whosoever has lacked (such) a skirt of love is left without share in that strown largesse of light. The faces of particulars are set towards the universal: nightingales play the game of love with the rose. The ox has his colour outside, but in the case of a man seek the red and yellow hues within.",3
"The good colours are from the vat of purity; the colour of the wicked is from the black water of iniquity. The baptism of God is the name of that subtle colour; the curse of God is the smell of that gross colour. That which is of the sea is going to the sea: it is going to the same place whence it came— From the mountain-top the swift-rushing torrents, and from our body the soul whose motion is mingled with love. How the Jewish king made a fire and placed an idol beside it, saying, “Whoever bows down to this idol shall escape the fire.” Now see what a plan this currish Jew contrived! He set up an idol beside the fire,",3
"Saying, “He that bows down to this idol is saved, and if he bow not, he shall sit in the heart of the fire.” Inasmuch as he did not give due punishment to this idol of self, from the idol of his self the other idol was born. The idol of your self is the mother of (all) idols, because that (material) idol is (only) a snake, while this (spiritual) idol is a dragon. The self is (as) iron and stone (whence fire is produced), while the (material) idol is (as) the sparks: those sparks are quieted (quenched) by water.(But) how should the stone and iron be allayed by water? How should a man, having these twain, be secure?",3
"The idol is the black water in a jug; the self is a fountain for the black water. That sculptured idol is like the black torrent; the idol-making self is a fountain full of water for it. A single piece of stone will break a hundred pitchers, but the fountain is jetting forth water incessantly. ’Tis easy to break an idol, very easy; to regard the self as easy (to subdue) is folly, folly. O son, if you seek (to know) the form of the self, read the story of Hell with its seven gates.",3
"Every moment (there proceeds from the self) an act of deceit, and in every one of those deceits a hundred Pharaohs are drowned together with their followers. Flee to the God of Moses and to Moses, do not from Pharaoh's quality (rebellious insolence) spill the water of the Faith. Lay your hand on (cleave to) the One (God) and Ahmad (Mohammed)! O brother, escape from the Bú Jahl of the body! How a child began to speak amidst the fire and urged the people to throw themselves into the fire. That Jew brought to that idol a woman with her child, and the fire was blazing. He took the child from her and cast it into the fire: the woman was affrighted and withdrew her heart from (abandoned) her faith.",3
"She was about to bow down before the idol (when) the child cried, “Verily, I am not dead. Come in, O mother: I am happy here, although in appearance I am amidst the fire. The fire is a spell that binds the eye for the sake of screening (the truth); this is (in reality) a Divine mercy which has raised its head from the collar (has been manifested from the Unseen). Come in, mother, and see the evidence of God, that thou mayst behold the delight of God's elect. Come in, and see water that has the semblance of fire; (come away) from a world which is (really) fire and (only) has the semblance of water.",3
"Come in, and see the mysteries of Abraham, who in the fire found cypress and jessamine. I was seeing death at the time of birth from thee: sore was my dread of falling from thee; (But) when I was born, I escaped from the narrow prison (of the womb) into a world of pleasant air and beautiful colour. Now I deem the (earthly) world to be like the womb, since in this fire I have seen such rest: In this fire I have seen a world wherein every atom possesses the (life-giving) breath of Jesus.",3
"Lo, (it is) a world apparently non-existent (but) essentially existent, while that (other) world is apparently existent (but) has no permanence. Come in, mother, (I beseech thee) by the right of motherhood: see this fire, how it hath no fieriness. Come in, mother, for felicity is come; come in, mother, do not let fortune slip from thy hand. Thou hast seen the power of that (Jewish) cur: come in, that thou mayst see the power of God's grace. ’Tis (only) out of pity that I am drawing thy feet (hither), for indeed such is my rapture that I have no care for thee.",3
"Come in and call the others also, for the King has spread a (festal) table within the fire. O true believers, come in, all of you: except this sweetness (‘adhbí) all is torment (‘adháb). Oh, come in, all of you, like moths; (come) into this fortune which hath a hundred springtimes.” (Thus) he was crying amidst that multitude: the souls of the people were filled with awe. After that, the folk, men and women (alike), cast themselves unwittingly into the fire—",3
"Without custodian, without being dragged, for love of the Friend, because from Him is the sweetening of every bitterness— Until it came to pass that the (king's) myrmidons were holding back the people, saying, “Do not enter the fire!” The Jew became black-faced (covered with shame) and dismayed; he became sorry and sick at heart, Because the people grew more loving (ardent) in their Faith and more firm in mortification (faná) of the body. Thanks (be to God), the Devil's plot caught him in its toils; thanks (be to God), the Devil saw himself disgraced.",3
"That which he was rubbing (the shame he was inflicting) on the faces of those persons (the Christians) was all accumulated on the visage of that vile wretch. He who was busy rending the garment (honour and integrity) of the people—his own (garment) was rent, (while) they were unhurt. How the mouth remained awry of a man who pronounced the name of Mohammed, on whom be peace, derisively. He made his mouth wry and called the name of Ahmad (Mohammed) in derision: his mouth remained awry. He came back, saying, “Pardon me, O Mohammed, O thou to whom belong the (Divine) gifts of esoteric knowledge. In my folly I was ridiculing thee, (but) I myself was related to ridicule and deserving it.”",3
"When God wishes to rend the veil of any one (expose him to shame), He turns his inclination towards reviling holy men. When God wishes to hide the blame of any one, he (that person) does not breathe a word of blame against the blameworthy. When God wishes to help us, He turns our inclination towards humble lament. Oh, happy the eye that is weeping for His sake! Oh, fortunate the heart that is seared for His sake! The end of every weeping is laughter at last; the man who foresees the end is a blessed servant (of God).",3
"Wherever is flowing water, there is greenery: wherever are running tears, (the Divine) mercy is shown. Be moaning and moist-eyed like the water-wheel, that green herbs may spring up from the courtyard of your soul. If you desire tears, have mercy on one who sheds tears; if you desire mercy, show mercy to the weak. How the fire reproached the Jewish king. The king turned his face to the fire, saying, “O fierce-tempered one, where is thy world-consuming natural disposition? How art thou not burning? What has become of thy specific property? Or has thy intention changed because of our fortune?",3
"Thou hast no pity (even) on the fire-worshipper: how (then) has he been saved who does not worship thee? Never, O fire, art thou patient: how burnest thou not? What is it? Hast thou not the power? Is this a spell, I wonder, that binds the eye or the mind? How does the lofty pyre not burn? Has some one bewitched thee? Or is it magic, or is thy unnatural behaviour from our fortune?” The fire said: “I am the same, I am fire: come in, that thou mayst feel my heat.",3
"My nature and element have not changed: I am the sword of God and by (His) leave I cut. The Turcoman dogs fawn at the tent-door before the guest, But if any one having the face of a stranger pass by the tent, he will see the dogs rushing at him like lions. I am not less than a dog in devotion, nor is God less than a Turcoman in life (living power).” If the fire of your nature make you suffer pain, it burns by command of the Lord of religion;",3
"If the fire of your nature give you joy, (that is because) the Lord of religion puts joy therein. When you feel pain, ask pardon of God: pain, by command of the Creator, is efficacious. When He pleases, pain itself becomes joy; bondage itself becomes freedom. Air and earth and water and fire are (His) slaves: with you and me they are dead, but with God they are alive. Before God, fire is always standing (ready to do His behest), writhing continually day and night, like a lover.",3
"If you strike stone on iron, it (the fire) leaps out: ’tis by God's command that it puts forth its foot. Do not strike together the iron and stone of injustice, for these two generate like man and woman. The stone and the iron are indeed causes, but look higher, O good man! For this (external) cause was produced by that (spiritual) cause: when did a cause ever proceed from itself without a cause? And those causes which guide the prophets on their way are higher than these (external) causes.",3
"That (spiritual) cause makes this (external) cause operative; sometimes, again, it makes it fruitless and ineffectual. (Ordinary) minds are familiar with this (external) cause, but the prophets are familiar with those (spiritual) causes. What is (the meaning of) this (word) “cause” (sabab) in Arabic? Say: “cord” (rasan). This cord came into this well (the world) by (Divine) artifice. The revolution of the water-wheel causes the cord (to move), (but) not to see the mover of the water-wheel is an error. Beware, beware! Do not regard these cords of causation in the world as (deriving their movement) from the giddy wheel (of heaven),",3
"Lest you remain empty and giddy like the (celestial) wheel, lest through brainlessness you burn like markh wood. By the command of God air becomes fire: both are drunken with the wine of God. O son, when you open your eyes you will see that from God too are the water of clemency and the fire of anger. Had not the soul of the wind been informed by God, how would it have distinguished (the believers and unbelievers) amongst the people of ‘Ád? The story of the wind which destroyed the people of ‘Ád in the time of (the prophet) Húd, on whom be peace. Húd drew a line round the believers: the wind would become soft (subside) when it reached that place,",3
"(Although) it was dashing to pieces in the air all who were outside of the line. Likewise Shaybán the shepherd used to draw a visible line round his flock Whenever he went to the Friday service at prayer-time, in order that the wolf might not raid and ravage there: No wolf would go into that (circle), nor would any sheep stray beyond that mark; The wind of the wolf's and sheeps' concupiscence was barred because of (by) the circle of the man of God.",3
"Even so, to those who know God (‘árifán) the wind of Death is soft and pleasant as the breeze (that wafts the scent) of (loved) ones like Joseph. The fire did not set its teeth in Abraham: how should it bite him, since he is the chosen of God? The religious were not afflicted by the fire of lust which bore all the rest down to the bottom of the earth. The waves of the sea, when they charged on by God's command, discriminated the people of Moses from the Egyptians. The earth, when the (Divine) command came, drew Qárún (Korah) with his gold and throne into its lowest depth.",3
"The water and clay, when it fed on the breath of Jesus, spread wings and pinions, became a bird, and flew. Your glorification (of God) is an exhalation from the water and clay (of your body): it became a bird of Paradise through the breathing (into it) of your heart's sincerity. Mount Mount Sinai, from (seeing) the radiance of Moses, began to dance, became a perfect Súfí, and was freed from blemish. What wonder if the mountain became a venerable Súfí? The body of Moses also was (formed) from a piece of clay. How the Jewish king scoffed and denied and would not accept the counsel of his intimates. The king of the Jews beheld these marvellous things, (but) he had naught (to say) except mockery and denial.",3
"His counsellors said, “Do not let (this injustice) go beyond bounds, do not drive the steed of obstinacy so far.” He handcuffed the counsellors and confined them, he committed one injustice after another. When the matter reached this pass, a shout came—“Hold thy foot (stop), O cur! For Our vengeance is come.” After that, the fire blazed up forty ells high, became a ring, and consumed those Jews. From fire was their origin in the beginning: they went (back) to their origin in the end.",3
"That company were born of fire: the way of particulars is towards the universal. They were only a fire to consume the true believers: their fire consumed itself like rubbish. He whose mother is Háwiya (Hell-fire)—Háwiya shall become his cell (abode). The mother of the child is (always) seeking it: the fundamentals pursue the derivatives. If water is imprisoned in a tank, the wind sucks it up, for it (the wind) belongs to the original (source):",3
"It sets it free, it wafts it away to its source, little by little, so that you do not see its wafting; And our souls likewise this breath (of ours) steals away, little by little, from the prison of the world. The perfumes of our (good) words ascend even unto Him, ascending from us whither God knoweth. Our breaths soar up with the choice (words), as a gift from us, to the abode of everlastingness; Then comes to us the recompense of our speech, a double (recompense) thereof, as a mercy from (God) the Glorious;",3
"Then He causes us to repair to (makes us utter) good words like those (already uttered), that His servant may obtain (something more) of what he has obtained. Thus do they (our good words) ascend while it (the Divine mercy) descends continually: mayst thou never cease to keep up that (ascent and descent)! Let us speak Persian: the meaning is that this attraction (by which God draws the soul towards Himself) comes from the same quarter whence came that savour (spiritual delight experienced in and after prayer). The eyes of every set of people remain (turned) in the direction where one day they satisfied a (longing for) delight. The delight of (every) kind is certainly in its own kind (congener): the delight of the part, observe, is in its whole;",3
"Or else, that (part) is surely capable of (attachment to) a (different) kind and, when it has attached itself thereto, becomes homogeneous with it, As (for instance) water and bread, which were not our congeners, became homogeneous with us and increased within us (added to our bulk and strength). Water and bread have not the appearance of being our congeners, (but) from consideration of the end (final result) deem them to be homogeneous (with us). And if our delight is (derived) from something not homogeneous, that (thing) will surely resemble the congener. That which (only) bears a resemblance is a loan: a loan is impermanent in the end.",3
"Although the bird is delighted by (the fowler's) whistle, it takes fright when it (sees him and) does not find its own congener. Although the thirsty man is delighted by the mirage, he runs away when he comes up to it, and seeks for water. Although the insolvent are pleased with base gold, yet that (gold) is put to shame in the mint. (Take heed) lest gildedness (imposture) cast you out of the (right) way, lest false imagination cast you into the well. Seek the story (illustrating this) from (the book of) Kalíla (and Dimna), and search out the moral (contained) in the story. Setting forth how the beasts of chase told the lion to trust in God and cease from exerting himself.",3
"A number of beasts of chase in a pleasant valley were harassed by a lion. Inasmuch as the lion was (springing) from ambush and carrying them away, that pasturage had become unpleasant to them all. They made a plot: they came to the lion, saying, “We will keep thee full-fed by means of a (fixed) allowance. Do not go after any prey beyond thy allowance, in order that this grass may not become bitter to us.” How the lion answered the beasts and explained the advantage of exertion. “Yes,” said he, “if I see (find) good faith (on your part), not fraud, for often have I seen (suffered) frauds from Zayd and Bakr.",4
"I am done to death by the cunning and fraud of men, I am bitten by the sting of (human) snake and scorpion; (But) worse than all men in fraud and spite is the man of the flesh (nafs) lying in wait within me. My ear heard ‘The believer is not bitten (twice),’ and adopted (this) saying of the Prophet with heart and soul.” How the beasts asserted the superiority of trust in God to exertion and acquisition. They all said: “O knowing sage, let precaution alone: it is of no avail against the Divine decree. In precaution is the embroilment of broil and woe: go, put thy trust in God: trust in God is better.",4
"Do not grapple with Destiny, O fierce and furious one, lest Destiny also pick a quarrel with thee. One must be dead in presence of the decree of God, so that no blow may come from the Lord of the daybreak.” How the lion upheld the superiority of exertion and acquisition to trust in God and resignation. “Yes,” he said; “(but) if trust in God is the (true) guide, (yet use of) the means too is the Prophet's rule (Sunna). The Prophet said with a loud voice, ‘While trusting in God bind the knee of thy camel.’ Hearken to the signification of ‘The earner (worker) is beloved of God’: through trusting in God do not become neglectful as to the (ways and) means.” How the beasts preferred trust in God to exertion.",4
"The party (of beasts) answered him, saying, “Regard acquisition (work), arising from the infirmity of (God's) creatures, as a mouthful of deceit proportionate to the size of the gullet. There is no work better than trust in God: what, indeed, is dearer (to God) than resignation? Often do they flee from affliction (only) to (fall into) affliction; often do they recoil from the snake (only) to (meet with) the dragon. Man devised (something), and his device was a snare (wherein he was trapped): that which he thought to be life was (actually) the drainer of his blood (his destroyer). He locked the door while the foe was in the house: the plot of Pharaoh was a story of this sort.",4
"That vengeful man slew hundreds of thousands of babes, while the one he was searching after was in his (Pharaoh's) house. Since in our eyesight (foresight) there is much defect, go, let your own sight pass away (faná) in the sight of the Friend (God). His sight for ours—what a goodly recompense! In His sight you will find the whole object of your desire. So long as the child could neither grasp (exert strength) nor run, he had nothing to ride on but his father's neck; When he became a busybody and plied hand and foot (exerted himself), he fell into trouble and wretchedness.",4
"The spirits of created beings, before (the creation of) hand and foot, by reason of their faithfulness were flying in (the realm of) purity; When they were constrained by the (Divine) command, Get ye down, they became engaoled in anger and covetousness and contentment. We are the family of the Lord and craving after milk (like infants): he (the Prophet) said, ‘The people are God's family.’ He who gives rain from heaven is also able, from His mercy, to give us bread.” How the lion again pronounced exertion to be superior to trust in God. “Yes,” said the lion; “but the Lord of His servants set a ladder before our feet.",4
"Step by step must we climb towards the roof: to be a necessitarian here is (to indulge in) foolish hopes. You have feet: why do you make yourself out to be lame? you have hands: why do you conceal the fingers (whereby yougrasp)? When the master put a spade in the slave's hand, his object was made known to him (the slave) without (a word falling from his) tongue. Hand and spade alike are His (God's) implicit signs; (our powers of) thinking upon the end are His explicit declarations. When you take His signs to heart, you will devote your life to fulfilling that indication (of His will).",4
"He will give you many hints (for the understanding) of mysteries, He will remove the burden from you and give you (spiritual) authority. Do you bear (His burden)? He will cause you to be borne (aloft). Do you receive (His commands)? He will cause you to be received (into His favour). If you accept His command, you will become the spokesman (thereof); if you seek union (with Him), thereafter you will become united. Freewill is the endeavour to thank (God) for His beneficence: your necessitarianism is the denial of that beneficence. Thanksgiving for the power (of acting freely) increases your power; necessitarianism takes the (Divine) gift (of freewill) out of your hand.",4
"Your necessitarianism is (like) sleeping on the road: do not sleep! Sleep not, until you see the gate and the threshold! Beware! do not sleep, O inconsiderate necessitarian, save underneath that fruit-laden tree, So that every moment the wind may shake the boughs and shower upon the sleeper (spiritual) dessert and provision for the journey. Necessitarianism is to sleep amidst highwaymen: how should the untimely bird receive quarter? And if you turn up your nose at His signs, you deem (yourself) a man, but when you consider (more deeply), you are (only) a woman.",4
"This measure of understanding which you possess is lost: a head from which the understanding is severed becomes a tail, Because ingratitude is wickedness and disgrace and brings the ingrate to the bottom of Hell-fire. If you are putting trust in God, put trust (in Him) as regards (your) work: sow (the seed), then rely upon the Almighty.” How the beasts once more asserted the superiority of trust in God to exertion. They all lifted up their voices (to dispute) with him, saying, “Those covetous ones who sowed (the seed of) means, Myriads on myriads of men and women—why, then, did they remain deprived of fortune?",4
"From the beginning of the world myriads of generations have opened a hundred mouths, like dragons: Those clever people devised plots (of such power) that the mountain thereby was torn up from its foundation. The Glorious (God) described their plots (when He said): (though their guile be such) that the tops of the mountains might be moved thereby. (But) except the portion which came to pass (was predestined) in eternity, nothing showed its face (accrued to them) from their scheming and doing. They all fell from (failed in) plan and act: the acts and decrees of the Maker remained.",4
"O illustrious one, do not regard work as aught but a name! O cunning one, think not that exertion is aught but a vain fancy!”How ‘Azrá‘íl (Azrael) looked at a certain man, and how that man fled to the palace of Solomon; and setting forth the superiority of trust in God to exertion and the uselessness of the latter. One forenoon a freeborn (noble) man arrived and ran into Solomon's hall of justice, His countenance pale with anguish and both lips blue. Then Solomon said, “Good sir, what is the matter?” He replied, “Azrael cast on me such a look, so full of wrath and hate.” “Come,” said the king, “what (boon) do you desire now? Ask (it)!” “O protector of my life,” said he, “command the wind,",4
"To bear me from here to India. Maybe, when thy slave is come thither he will save his life.” Lo, the people are fleeing from poverty: hence are they a mouthful for (a prey to) covetousness and expectation. The fear of poverty is like that (man's) terror: know thou that covetousness and striving are (like) India (in this tale). He (Solomon) commanded the wind to bear him quickly over the water to the uttermost part of India. Next day, at the time of conference and meeting, Solomon said to Azrael:",4
"“Didst thou look with anger on that Moslem in order that he might wander (as an exile) far from his home?” Azrael said, “When did I look (on him) angrily? I saw him as I passed by, (and looked at him) in astonishment, For God had commanded me, saying, ‘Hark, to-day do thou take his spirit in India.’ From wonder I said (to myself), ‘(Even) if he has a hundred wings, ’tis a far journey for him to be in India (to-day).’” In like manner judge of all the affairs of this world and open your eye and see!",4
"From whom shall we flee? From ourselves? Oh, absurdity! From whom shall we take (ourselves) away? From God? Oh, crime! How the lion again declared exertion to be superior to trust in God and expounded the advantages of exertion. “Yes,” said the lion; “but at the same time consider the exertions of the prophets and the true believers. God, exalted is He, prospered their exertion and what they suffered of oppression and heat and cold. Their plans were excellent in all circumstances: everything done by a goodly man is goodly. Their snares caught the Heavenly bird, all their deficiencies turned to increment.”",4
"O master, exert thyself so long as thou canst in (following) the way of the prophets and saints! Endeavour is not a struggle with Destiny, because Destiny itself has laid this (endeavour) upon us. I am an infidel if any one has suffered loss a single moment (while walking) in the way of faith and obedience. Your head is not broken: do not bandage this head. Exert yourself (in doing good works) for a day or two (i.e. during this brief life), and laugh unto everlasting! An evil resort sought he that sought this world; a good state sought he that sought the world to come.",4
"Plots for gaining (the things of) this world are worthless, (but) plots for renouncing this world are inspired (by God). The (right) plot is that he (the prisoner) digs a hole in his prison (in order to escape); if he blocks up the hole, that is a foolish plot. This world is the prison, and we are the prisoners: dig a hole in the prison and let yourself out! What is this world? To be forgetful of God; it is not merchandise and silver and weighing-scales and women. As regards the wealth that you carry for religion's sake, “How good is righteous wealth (for the righteous man)!” as the Prophet recited.",4
"Water in the boat is the ruin of the boat, (but) water underneath the boat is a support. Since he cast out from his heart (the desire for) wealth and possessions, on that account Solomon did not call himself (by any name) but “poor.” The stoppered jar, (though) in rough water, floated on the water because of its windfilled (empty) heart. When the wind of poverty is within (any one), he rests at peace on the surface of the water of the world; Although the whole of this world is his kingdom, in the eye of his heart the kingdom is nothing.",4
"Therefore stopper and seal the mouth of your heart, and fill it from the inward ventilator. Exertion is a reality, and medicine and disease are realities: the sceptic in his denial of exertion practised (and thereby affirmed) exertion. How the superiority of exertion to trust in God was established. The lion gave many proofs in this style, so that those necessitarians became tired of answering (him). Fox and deer and hare and jackal abandoned (the doctrine of) necessity and (ceased from) disputation. They made covenants with the furious lion, (ensuring) that he should incur no loss in this bargain,",4
"(That) the daily ration should come to him without trouble, and that he should not need to make a further demand. Day by day the one on whom the lot fell would run to the lion as (swiftly as) a cheetah. When this cup (of death) came round to the hare, the hare cried out, “Why, how long (are we to endure this) injustice?” How the beasts of chase blamed the hare for his delay in going to the lion. The company (of beasts) said to him: “All this time we have sacrificed our lives in troth and loyalty. Do not thou seek to give us a bad name, O rebellious one! Lest the lion be aggrieved, go, go! Quick! Quick!” How the hare answered the beasts.",4
"“O friends,” said he, “grant me a respite, that by my cunning ye may escape from calamity, That by my cunning your lives may be saved and this (safety) remain as a heritage to your children.” Every prophet amidst the peoples used to call them after this manner to a place of deliverance, For he had seen from Heaven the way of escape, (though) in (their) sight he was contracted (despicable) like the pupil of the eye. Men regarded him as small like the pupil: none attained to (understanding of) the (real) greatness (worth) of the pupil. How the beasts objected to the proposal of the hare.",4
"The company (of beasts) said to him: “O donkey, listen (to us)! Keep thyself within the measure of a hare! Eh, what brag is this—(an idea) which thy betters never brought into their minds? Thou art self-conceited, or Destiny is pursuing us; else, how is this speech suitable to one like thee? How the hare again answered the beasts. He said: “O friends, God gave me inspiration: to a weakling there came a strong judgement (wise counsel).” That which God taught to the bees is not (belonging) to the lion and the wild ass.",4
"It (the bee) makes houses of juicy halwá (sweetmeat): God opened to it the door of that knowledge; That which God taught to the silkworm—does any elephant know such a device? Adam, created of earth, learned knowledge from God: (his) knowledge shot beams up to the Seventh Heaven. He (Adam) broke the name and fame (pride) of the angels, to the confusion of that one who is in doubt concerning God. He (God) made the ascetic of so many thousand years (Iblís) a muzzle for that young calf (Adam),",4
"That he (Adam) might not be able to drink the milk of knowledge of religion, and that he might not roam around that lofty castle. The sciences of the followers of (external) sense became a muzzle, so that he (the believer in sense-perception) might not receive milk from that sublime knowledge. (But) into the blood-drop (core) of the heart there fell a jewel which He (God) gave not to the seas and skies. How long (this regard for) form? After all, O form-worshipper, has thy reality-lacking soul not (yet) escaped from form? If a human being were a man in virtue of form, Ahmad (Mohammed) and Bú Jahl would be just the same.",4
"The painting on the wall is like Adam: see from the (pictured) form what thing in it is wanting. The spirit is wanting in that resplendent form: go, seek that jewel rarely found! The heads of all the lions in the world were laid low when They (God) gave a hand to (bestowed favour on) the dog of the Companions (of the Cave). What loss does it suffer from that abhorred shape, inasmuch as its spirit was plunged in the ocean of light? ’Tis not in pens to describe (the outward) form: (what is written) in letters is (qualities like) “learned” and “just”;",4
"(And qualities like) “learned” and “just” are only the spiritual essence which thou wilt not find in (any) place or in front or behind. The sun of the spirit strikes (with its beams) on the body from the quarter where (the relation of) place does not exist: it (that sun) is not contained in the sky. An account of the knowledge of the hare and an explanation of the excellence and advantages of knowledge. This topic hath no end. Give heed! Listen to the story of the hare. Sell your asinine (corporeal) ear and buy another ear, for the asinine ear will not apprehend this discourse. Go, behold the foxy tricks played by the hare; behold how the hare made a plot to catch the lion.",4
"Knowledge is the seal of the kingdom of Solomon: the whole world is form, and knowledge is the spirit. Because of this virtue, the creatures of the seas and those of mountain and plain are helpless before man. Of him the pard and lion are afraid, like the mouse; from him the crocodile of the great river is in pallor and agitation. From him peri and demon took to the shores (sought refuge): each took abode in some hiding-place. Man hath many a secret enemy: the cautious man is a wise one.",4
"(There are) hidden creatures, evil and good: at every instant their blows are striking on the heart. If you go into the river to wash yourself, a thorn in the water inflicts a hurt upon you. Although the thorn is hidden low in the water, you know it is there, since it is pricking you. The pricks of (angelic) inspirations and (satanic) temptations are from thousands of beings, not (only) from one. Wait (patiently) for your (bodily) senses to be transmuted, so that you may see them (the hidden beings), and the difficulty may be solved,",4
"So that (you may see) whose words you have rejected and whom you have made your captain. How the beasts requested the hare to tell the secret of his thought. Afterwards they said, “O nimble hare, communicate what is in thy apprehension. O thou who hast grappled with a lion, declare the plan which thou hast thought of. Counsel gives perception and understanding: the mind is helped by (other) minds. The Prophet said, ‘O adviser, take counsel (with the trustworthy), for he whose counsel is sought is trusted.’” How the hare withheld the secret from them.",4
"He said, “One ought not to say forth every secret: sometimes the even number turns out to be odd, and sometimes the odd number to be even.” If from guilelessness you breathe words to a mirror, the mirror at once becomes dim to us. Do not move your lip in explanation of these three things, (namely) concerning your departure and your gold and your religion; For to these three there is many an adversary and foe standing in wait for you when he knows (about any of them). And if you tell (only) one or two (a few people), farewell (to your secret): every secret that goes beyond the twain (who share it) is published abroad.",4
"If you tie two or three birds together, they will remain on the ground, imprisoned by grief; (But in truth) they hold a consultation well-disguised and mingled, in its (apparent) significance, with that which casts error (into the mind of any one who observes them). (Similarly) the Prophet used to take counsel, (speaking) cryptically, and they (his companions) would answer him and (would be) without knowledge (of his real meaning). He would speak his opinion in a covert parable, in order that the adversary might not know foot from head. He (the Prophet) would receive his answer from him (the adversary), while the other would not catch the smell (drift) of his question. The story of the hare's stratagem.",4
"He delayed awhile in going, then he went before the lion who rends (his prey) with claws. Because he tarried late in going, the lion was tearing up the earth and roaring. “I said,” cried the lion, “that the promise of those vile ones would be vain—vain and frail and unfulfilled. Their palaver has duped me: how long will this Time deceive me, how long?” The prince that hath no strength in his beard is left sorely in the lurch when by reason of his folly he looks neither backwards nor forwards.",4
"The road is smooth, and under it are pitfalls: amidst the names there is a dearth of meaning. Words and names are like pitfalls: the sweet (flattering) word is the sand for (the sand that sucks up) the water of our life. The one sand whence water gushes is seldom to be found: go, seek it. He that searches after wisdom becomes a fountain of wisdom; he becomes independent of acquisition and (ways and) means. The guarding tablet becomes a Guarded Tablet; his understanding becomes enriched by the Spirit.",4
"When a man's understanding has been his teacher, after this the understanding becomes his pupil. The understanding says, like Gabriel, “O Ahmad (Mohammed), if I take one (more) step, it will burn me; Do thou leave me, henceforth advance (alone): this is my limit, O sultan of the soul!” Whoever, through heedlessness, remains without thanksgiving and patience (selfcontrol), knows (no resource) but this, that he should follow in the heels of necessity (jabr). Any one who pleads necessity (as an excuse) feigns himself to be ill, with the result that the (feigned) illness brings him to the grave.",4
"The Prophet said, “Illness (assumed) in jest brings (real) disease, so that he (the jester) dies like a lamp.” What is (the meaning of) jabr? To bind up a broken (limb) or tie a severed vein. Inasmuch as you have not broken your foot in this path, whom are you mocking? Why have you bandaged your foot? But as for him who broke his foot in the path of exertion, Buráq came up to him, and he mounted (and rode). He was a bearer of the (true) religion, and he became one who is borne; he was an accepter of the (Divine) command, and he became accepted.",4
"Until now, he was receiving commands from the King; henceforth he delivers the (King's) commands to the people. Until now, the stars were influencing him; henceforth he is the ruler of the stars. If (on this account) perplexity arise in thy sight (mind), then thou wilt have doubts concerning The moon was cloven asunder. Refresh thy faith, (but) not with talk of the tongue, O thou who hast secretly refreshed thy (evil) desire. So long as desire is fresh, faith is not fresh, for ’tis this desire that locks (against thee) that gate.",4
"Thou hast interpreted (and altered the meaning of) the virgin (uncorrupted) Word: interpret (alter) thyself, not the (Divine) Book. Thou interpretest the Qur’án according to thy desire: by thee the sublime meaning is degraded and perverted.The baseness of the foul interpretation given by the fly. The fly was lifting up his head, like a pilot, on a blade of straw and (a pool of) ass's urine. “I have called (them) sea and ship,” said he; “I have been pondering over that (interpretation) for a long while. Look! here is this sea and this ship, and I am the pilot and skilled (in navigation) and judicious.”",4
"He was propelling the raft on the “sea”: that (small) quantity appeared to him illimitable. That urine was boundless in relation to him: where was the vision that should see it truly? His world extends (just) as far as his sight reaches; his eye is so big, his “sea” is big in the same proportion. So with the false interpreter (of the Qur’án): like the fly, his imagination is (foul as) ass's urine and his conception (worthless as) a straw. If the fly leave off interpreting by (following his own) opinion, Fortune will turn that fly into a humáy.",4
"One who possesses this (Divine) indication (of the true meaning) is not a fly: his spirit is not analogous to his (outward) form. How the lion roared wrathfully because the hare was late in coming. As (for example) the hare who struck against the lion: how was his spirit analogous to his stature? The lion from fury and rage was saying, “By means of my ear the enemy has bound up my eye. The tricks of the necessitarians have bound me (in captivity); their wooden sword has wounded my body. After this I will not hearken to their palaver: all that is (only meant to deceive, like) the cry of demons and ghouls.",4
"O my heart, tear them to pieces, do not lag; rend their skins, for they have naught but skin.” What is skin? Specious words, like ripples on water which have no continuance. Know that these words are as the skin (rind), and the meaning is (as) the kernel; these words are as the form, and the meaning is like the spirit. The skin hides the defect of the bad kernel; it (also) hides jealously the secrets of the good kernel. When the pen is of wind and the scroll of water, whatever you write perishes speedily;",4
"It is written on water: if you seek constancy from it, you will return biting your hands (in disappointment). The wind in men is vanity and desire; when you have abandoned vanity, (then) is (the time for) the message from Him (God). Sweet are the messages of the Maker, for it (that message) from head to foot (from first to last) is enduring. The khutbas for kings change (and pass), and their empire; (all will pass) except the empire and khutbas (insignia) of the prophets, Because the pomp of kings is from (earthly) vanity, (while) the glorious privilege of the prophets is from (Divine) Majesty.",4
"The names of kings are removed from the dirhems, (but) the name of Ahmad (Mohammed) is stamped on them for ever. The name of Ahmad is the name of all the prophets: when the hundred comes (is counted), ninety is with us as well. Further setting forth the stratagem of the hare. The hare made much delay in going; he rehearsed to himself the tricks (which he was about to play). After long delay he came on (took) the road, that he might say one or two secrets into the ear of the lion. Think, what worlds are in commerce with Reason! How wide is this ocean of Reason!",4
"In this sweet ocean our forms are moving fast, like cups on the surface of water: Until they become full, (they float) like bowls on the top of the sea, (but) when the bowl is filled it sinks therein. Reason is hidden, and (only) a world (of phenomena) is visible: our forms are the waves or a spray of it (of that hidden ocean). Whatsoever (thing) the form makes (uses as) a means of approach to It (to Reason), by that (same) means the ocean (of Reason) casts it (the form) far away. So long as the heart does not see the Giver of (its) conscience, so long as the arrow does not see the far-shooting Archer,",4
"He (who is thus blind) thinks his horse is lost, though (all the while) he is obstinately speeding his horse on the road. That fine fellow thinks his horse is lost, while his horse is sweeping him onward like the wind. In lamentation and inquiry that scatterbrain (runs) from door to door in every direction, asking and searching: “Where and who is he that stole my horse?” What is this (animal) under thy thigh, O master? “Yes, this is the horse, but where is the horse?” O dexterous rider in search of thy horse, come to thyself!",4
"The Spirit is lost (to view) because of its being so manifest and near: how, having thy belly full of water, art thou dry- lipped like a jar? How wilt thou see red and green and russet, unless before (seeing) these three (colours) thou see the light? But since thy mind was lost (absorbed) in (perception of) the colour, those colours became to thee a veil from (debarred thee from contemplating) the light. Inasmuch as at night those colours were hidden, thou sawest that thy vision of the colour was (derived) from the light. There is no vision of colour without the external light: even so it is with the colour of inward phantasy.",4
"This outward (light) is (derived) from the sun and from Suhá, while the inward (light) is from the reflexion of the beams of (Divine) Glory. The light which gives light to the eye is in truth the light of the heart: the light of the eye is produced by the light of hearts. Again, the light which gives light to the heart is the Light of God, which is pure and separate from the light of intellect and sense. At night there was no light: thou didst not see the colour; then it (the light) was made manifest by the opposite of light (by darkness). (First) comes the seeing of light, then the seeing of colour; and this thou knowest immediately by the opposite of light (darkness).",4
"God created pain and sorrow for the purpose that happiness might be made manifest by means of this opposite. Hidden things, then, are manifested by means of their opposite; since God hath no opposite, He is hidden; For the sight fell (first) on the light, then on the colour: opposite is made manifest by opposite, like Greeks and Ethiopians. Therefore thou knewest light by its opposite: opposite reveals opposite in (the process of) coming forth. The Light of God hath no opposite in (all) existence, that by means of that opposite it should be possible to make Him manifest: ",4
"Necessarily (therefore) our eyes do not perceive Him, though He perceives (us): see this (fact) from (the case of) Moses and the mountain (Sinai). Know that form springs from spirit (reality) as the lion from the jungle, or as voice and speech from thought. This speech and voice arose from thought; thou knowest not where is the sea of thought, But since thou hast seen that the waves of speech are fair, thou knowest that their sea also is noble. When the waves of thought sped on from (the sea of) Wisdom, it (Wisdom) made (for them) the form of speech and voice.",4
"The form was born of the Word and died again, the wave drew itself back into the sea. The form came forth from Formlessness and went back (thither), for Verily unto Him are we returning. Every instant, then, thou art dying and returning: Mustafá declared that this world is (but) a moment. Our thought is an arrow (shot) from Him (Hú) into the air (hawá): how should it stay in the air? It comes (back) to God. Every moment the world is renewed, and we are unaware of its being renewed whilst it remains (the same in appearance).",4
"Life is ever arriving anew, like the stream, though in the body it has the semblance of continuity. From its swiftness it appears continuous, like the spark which thou whirlest rapidly with thy hand. If thou whirl a firebrand with dexterity, it appears to the sight as a very long (line of) fire. The swift motion produced by the action of God presents this length of duration (Time) as (a phenomenon arising) from the rapidity of Divine action. Even if the seeker of this mystery is an exceedingly learned man, (say to him), “Lo, Husámu’ddín, who is a sublime book (where you will find the mystery revealed).” The hare's coming to the lion and the lion's anger with him.",4
"The lion, incensed and wrathful and frantic, saw the hare coming from afar, Running undismayed and confidently, looking angry and fierce and fell and sour, For by coming humbly (he thought) suspicion would be (excited), while by boldness every cause of doubt would be removed. When he came further on, near to the “shoe-row,” the lion shouted—“Ha, villain! I who have torn oxen limb from limb, I who have rubbed the ear of (chastised and vanquished) the ferocious elephant—",4
"Who (what) is a half-witted (feeble) hare, that he should thus throw on the ground (disregard) my behest?” Abandon the hare's slumber and heedlessness! Give ear, O donkey, to the roaring of this lion! The hare's apology. “Mercy!” cried the hare, “I have an excuse, if thy Lordship's pardon come to my aid.” “What excuse?” said he. “Oh, the shortsightedness of fools! Is this the time for them to come into the presence of kings? Thou art an untimely bird: thy head must be cut off. One ought not to hear the excuse of a fool.",4
"The fool's excuse is worse than his crime; the excuse of the ignorant is the poison that kills wisdom. Thy excuse, O hare, is devoid of wisdom: what hare am I that thou shouldst put it in my ear?” “O king,” he replied, “account a worthless one to be worthy: hearken to the excuse of one who has suffered oppression. In particular, as an alms (thank-offering) for thy high estate, do not drive out of thy way one whose way is lost. The ocean, which gives some water to every stream, lays on its head and face (surface) every piece of rubbish.",4
"By this bounty the sea will not become less: the sea is neither increased nor diminished by its bounty.” The lion said, “I will bestow bounty in its (proper) place, I will cut every one's clothes according to his stature.” “Listen,” cried the hare, “if I am not a fit object for (thy) grace, I lay my head before the dragon of (thy) violence. At breakfast-time I set out on the way, I came towards the king with my comrade. That party (of beasts) had appointed, for thy sake, another hare to go along with me as consort and companion.",4
"On the road a lion attacked thy humble slave, attacked both the companions in travel who were coming (to thee). I said to him, ‘We are the slaves of the King of kings, the lowly fellow-servants of that (exalted) court.’ He said, ‘The King of kings! Who is he? Be ashamed! Do not make mention of every base loon in my presence. Both thee and thy king I will tear to pieces, if thou and thy friend turn back from my door.’ I said to him, ‘Let me behold once more the face of the king and bear the news of thee (to him).’",4
"He said, ‘Place thy comrade with me (in my keeping) as a pledge; otherwise, thou art a sacrifice (thy life is forfeit) according to my law.’ We entreated him much: it was no use. He seized my friend and left me to go alone. My friend, from his plumpness, made three of me both in comeliness and beauty and (size of) body. Henceforth this road is barred by that lion: the thread of our covenants is broken. Cut off (abandon) hope of the allowance henceforth; I am telling thee the truth, and truth is bitter.",4
"If thou want the allowance, clear the way! hey, come on and repel that irreverent one!” How the lion answered the hare and set off with him. “Come on in God's name,” said he, “let me see where he is! Go thou in front, if thou art speaking truth, That I may give him and a hundred like him the punishment they deserve, or if this is a lie, that I may give thy deserts to thee.” The hare set out on the way, (going) in front like a guide, that he might lead him towards his snare, Towards the well which he had designated: he had made the deep well a snare for his (the lion's) life.",4
"(Thus) were these twain going till (they arrived) near the well. Look, you, (this was) a hare (deceitful) as a (pool of) water (hidden) under straw. The water bears a blade of straw (down) to the plain: how, I wonder, will the straw bear away a mountain? The snare of his (the hare's) guile was a noose for the lion: a marvellous hare (he), who was carrying off a lion (as his prey)! A Moses draws Pharaoh, with his army and mighty host, into the river Nile; A single gnat with half a wing cleaves intrepidly the suture of Nimrod's skull.",4
"Behold the state of him who hearkened to the words of his enemy, and the retribution of him who became the friend of the envious one— The state of a Pharaoh who hearkened to Haman, and the state of a Nimrod who hearkened to Satan. Albeit the enemy speak to thee in friendly wise, know (his words to be) the snare, though he speak to thee of the grain (bait). If he give thee some candy, regard it as poison; if he do a kindness to thy body, regard it as cruelty. When the (Divine) destiny comes to pass, you see naught but the skin (outward appearance): you do not distinguish enemies from friends.",4
"Since the case is thus, begin humble supplication; set about lamenting and glorifying (God) and fasting. Lament continually, crying, “O Thou who well knowest the hidden things, do not crush us beneath the stone of evil contrivance. O Creator of the lion, if we have wrought currishness, do not set the lion (to spring) on us from this covert. Do not give to sweet water the form of fire, do not put upon fire the form of water. When Thou makest (us) drunken with the wine of Thy wrath, Thou givest to things non-existent the form of existence.”",4
"What is (this) drunkenness? That which binds (prevents) the eye from (true) eyesight, so that a (common) stone appears a jewel, and wool (pashm) a jasper (yashm). What is (this) drunkenness? The perversion of the senses, the change of tamarisk-wood into sandal-wood in the (perverted) sight. Story of the hoopoe and Solomon, showing that when the Divine destiny comes to pass, clear eyes are sealed. When the tent-pavilion was pitched for Solomon, the birds came before him to pay obeisance. They found (him) speaking the same tongue (as themselves) and familiar with them: one by one they sped with (eager) soul into his presence. All the birds, having ceased from twittering, (in converse) with Solomon became more distinct (spoke more articulately) than your own brother.",4
"To speak the same tongue is a kinship and affinity: a man, (when he is) with those in whom he cannot confide, is like a prisoner in chains. Oh, many are the Indians and Turks that speak the same tongue; oh, many the pair of Turks that are as strangers (to each other). Therefore the tongue of mutual understanding is different indeed: to be one in heart is better than to be one in tongue. Without speech and without sign or scroll, hundreds of thousands of interpreters arise from the heart. The birds, all and each, their secrets of skill and knowledge and practice",4
"Were revealing, one by one, to Solomon, and were praising themselves by way of submitting a request (for his consideration), Not from pride and self-conceit, (but) in order that he might give them access to him. When a captive wants a lord (to buy him as a slave), he offers a preface (summary account) of his talent; (But) when he is ashamed (disgusted) at his buying him, he makes himself out to be sick and palsied and deaf and lame. The turn came for the hoopoe and his craft and the explanation of his skill and thoughtfulness.",4
"“O king,” said he, “I will declare (only) one talent, which is an inferior one; ’tis better to speak briefly.” “Tell on,” said Solomon; “let me hear what talent that is.” The hoopoe said, “At the time when I am at the zenith,I gaze from the zenith with the eye of certainty and I see the water at the bottom of the earth, So that (I know) where it is and what is its depth; what its colour is, whence it gushes forth—from clay or from rock. O Solomon, for the sake of thine army's camping-place keep this wise one (beside thee) on thy expeditions.”",4
"Then said Solomon, “O good companion in waterless far-stretching wastes!” How the crow impugned the claim of the hoopoe. When the crow heard (this), from envy he came and said to Solomon, “He has spoken false and ill. It is not respectful to speak in the king's presence, in particular (to utter) lying and absurd self-praise. If he had always had this (keen) sight, how would not he have seen the snare beneath a handful of earth? How would he have been caught in the snare? How would he have gone into the cage willy-nilly?”",4
"Then Solomon said: “O hoopoe, is it right that these dregs have risen from thee at the first cup? O thou who hast drunk buttermilk, how dost thou pretend intoxication and brag in my presence and tell lies besides?” The hoopoe's answer to the attack of the crow. He said, “O king, for God's sake do not listen to the enemy's words against me, bare beggar as I am. If this which I claim is not (true), I lay my head (before thee): sever this neck of mine. The crow, who disbelieves in the (absolute) authority of the Divine destiny, is an infidel, though he have thousands of wits.",4
"Whilst there is in you a single k (derived) from the káfirán (infidels), you are the seat of stench and lust, velut rima femoris. I see the snare (when I am) in the air, if the Divine destiny do not muffle the eye of my intelligence. When the Divine destiny comes, wisdom goes to sleep, the moon becomes black, the sun is stopped (from shining). How is this disposal (of things) by the Divine destiny (to be called) singular? Know that it is by the Divine destiny that he (the infidel) disbelieves in the Divine destiny. The story of Adam, on whom be peace, and how the Divine destiny sealed up his sight so that he failed to observe the plain meaning of the prohibition and to refrain from interpreting it. The father of mankind, who is the lord of He (God) taught (Adam) the Names, hath hundreds of thousands of sciences in every vein.",4
"To his soul accrued (knowledge of) the name of every thing, even as that thing exists (in its real nature) unto the end (of the world). No title that he gave became changed: that one whom he called ‘brisk’ did not become ‘lazy.’ Whoso is (to be) a believer at the last, he saw at the first; whoso is (to be) an infidel at the last, to him it became manifest. Do thou hear the name of every thing from the knower: hear the inmost meaning of the mystery of He taught the Names. With us, the name of every thing is its outward (appearance); with the Creator, the name of every thing is its inward (reality). ",4
"In the eyes of Moses the name of his rod was ‘staff’; in the eyes of the Creator its name was ‘dragon.’ Here the name of ‘Umar was ‘idolater,’ but in Alast. his name was ‘believer.’ That of which the name, with us, was ‘seed’ was, in the sight of God, thou who art at this moment beside me. This ‘seed’ was a form (idea) in non-existence (potentiality), existent with God, neither more nor less (than the form in which it appeared externally). In brief, that which is our end is really our name with God.",4
"He bestows on a man a name according to his final state, not according to that (state) to which He gives the name of ‘a loan.’ Inasmuch as the eye of Adam saw by means of the Pure Light, the soul and inmost sense of the names became evident to him. Since the angels perceived in him the rays of God, they fell in worship and hastened to do homage. The Adam like this whose name I am celebrating, if I praise (him) till the Resurrection, I fall short (of what is due). All this he knew; (yet) when the Divine destiny came, he was at fault in the knowledge of a single prohibition,",4
"Wondering whether the prohibition was for the purpose of making unlawful (the thing prohibited), or whether it admitted of an interpretation and was a cause of perplexity. When (the view that it admitted of) interpretation prevailed in his mind, his nature hastened in bewilderment towards the wheat. When the thorn went into the foot of the gardener (Adam), the thief (Satan) found an opportunity and quickly carried off the goods. As soon as he escaped from bewilderment, he returned into the (right) road; (then) he saw that the thief had carried off the wares from the shop. He cried, ‘O Lord, we have done wrong,’ and ‘Alas,’ that is to say, ‘darkness came and the way was lost.’",4
"This Divine destiny is a cloud that covers the sun: thereby lions and dragons become as mice. If I (the hoopoe) do not see a snare in the hour of Divine ordainment, ’tis not I alone who am ignorant in the course of Divine ordainment.” Oh, happy he that clave to righteousness, he (that) let (his own) strength go and took to supplication! If the Divine destiny shrouds thee in black like night, yet the Divine destiny will take thy hand (and guide thee) at the last. If the Divine destiny a hundred times attempts thy life, yet the Divine destiny gives thee life and heals thee.",4
"This Divine destiny, if a hundred times it waylays thee, (nevertheless) pitches thy tent on the top of Heaven. Know that this is from the loving kindness (of God), that He terrifies thee in order that He may establish thee in the kingdom of security. This subject hath no end. ’Tis late. Hearken (now) to the story of the hare and the lion. How the hare drew back from the lion when he approached the well. When the lion came near the well, he saw that the hare lagged on the way and stepped back. He said, “Why have you stepped back? Do not step back, come on!”",4
"The hare said, “Where is my (power to move a) foot? for (both) hand and foot are gone. My soul trembles and my heart (courage) has fled. Seest thou not the colour of my face (pale) as gold? My colour indeed is giving knowledge of my inward state. Since God has called the (external) sign (aspect) informative, the eye of the gnostic has remained turned towards the sign. Colour and scent are significant like a bell: the neigh of a horse makes (one) acquainted with the horse. The sound made by any thing conveys knowledge of it, so that you may distinguish the bray of an ass from the creak of a door.",4
"Touching the discrimination of persons (one from another), the Prophet said, ‘A man is hidden when his tongue is folded up.’ The colour of the face indicates the state of the heart: have pity on me, implant love of me in thy heart. A red complexion has the sound of (declares and expresses) thankfulness (satisfaction); the sound (signification) of a pale complexion is patience and unthankfulness. There has come upon me that which took away hand and foot, took away colour of face and strength and (every outward) mark; That which shatters every thing it comes upon, tears up every tree from root and bottom;",4
"There has come upon me that by which man and animal, mineral and plant have been checkmated. These indeed are (only) parts, (but) wholes (too) are by him (Doom) made yellow in hue and corrupt in odour, So that the world is now patient, now thankful; the garden now puts on a robe (of verdure) and again is bare. The sun, which rises fire-coloured, at another hour sinks headlong. Stars shining in the four quarters (of the sky) are, from time to time, afflicted with (consumed by) burning.",4
"The moon, which excels the stars in beauty, becomes like a phantom from the malady of a hectic fever. This earth, quiet and controlled, is thrown by earthquakes into feverish tremors. Oh, from this inherited woe many a mountain in the world has become tiny fragments and (grains of) sand. This air is conjoined with the (vital) spirit, (but) when the Divine destiny comes, it turns foul and stinking. The sweet water that was a sister (congenial) to the spirit, (after standing) in a pool, became yellow and bitter and turbid.",4
"The fire that has wind in its moustache—a single puff of wind calls death upon it. The state of the sea (is such that) from its agitation and commotion (you may) perceive the changes of its mind. The whirling heaven, which is (ever engaged) in seeking and searching—its state is like the state of its children; Now nadir, now middle, now zenith: therein are host on host of stars fortunate and unlucky. From thyself, O part made up of wholes, apprehend the state of every simple (uncompounded) thing.",4
"Inasmuch as wholes suffer grief and pain, how should their part not be pale-faced (sick and subject to decay)? Especially a part which is composed of contraries—of water and earth and fire and air. It is no wonder that the sheep recoiled from the wolf; the wonder is that this sheep set its heart on (became friendly with) the wolf. Life is the peace (harmony) of contraries; death is the fact that war arose between them. The grace of God has given amity to this lion and wild-ass— these two far distant contraries.",4
"Since the world is sick and a prisoner, what wonder if the sick one is passing away?” From this point of view he (the hare) recited counsels to the lion. “I have lagged behind,” said he, “because of these bonds.” How the lion asked the reason of the hare's drawing back. The lion said to him, “Amongst (all) the causes of your malady tell (me) the special cause, for this is my object.” “That lion,” he said, “lives in this well: within this fortress he is safe from harms.” Every one who is wise chose the bottom of the well (to live in), because spiritual joys are (to be attained only) in solitude.",4
"The darkness of the well is better than the dark shades of the world: he that followed at the heels of the world never saved his head. “Come on,” said the lion; “my blow subdues him: see thou whether that lion is in the well at present.” The hare answered, “I am consumed with (dread of) that fieriness (wrath): perhaps thou wilt take me beside thee, That with thy support, O mine of generosity, I may open my eyes and look into the well.” How the lion looked into the well and saw the reflexion of himself and the hare in the water. When the lion took him to his side, under the lion's protection he began to run towards the well.",4
"As soon as they looked at the water in the well, there shone forth in the water the light (reflected) from the lion and him (the hare). The lion saw his own reflexion: from the water shone the image of a lion with a plump hare at his side. When he beheld his adversary in the water, he left him (the hare) and sprang into the well. He fell into the well which he had dug, because his iniquity was coming (back) on his own head. The iniquity of evil-doers became (for them) a dark well: so have said all the wise.",4
"The more iniquitous one is, the more frightful is his well: (Divine) Justice has ordained worse (punishment) for worse (sin). O you who from iniquity are digging a well (for others), you are making a snare for yourself. Do not weave (a cocoon) round yourself, like the silkworm. You are digging a well for yourself (to fall in): dig with moderation (not too deep). Deem not the weak to be without a champion: recite from the Qur’án (the words), When the help of God shall come. If you are an elephant and your foe fled from you, lo, the retribution came upon you, birds in flocks.",4
"If any poor man on the earth beg for mercy, a loud tumult falls on (arises among) the Host of Heaven. If you bite him with your teeth and make him bleed, toothache will attack you—how will you do (then)? The lion saw himself in the well, and in his fury he did not know himself at that moment from the enemy. He regarded his own reflexion as his enemy: necessarily he drew a sword against himself. Oh, many an iniquity that you see in others is your own nature (reflected) in them, O reader!",4
"In them shone forth all that you are in your hypocrisy and iniquity and insolence. You are that (evil-doer), and you are striking those blows at yourself: ’tis yourself you are cursing at that moment. You do not see clearly the evil in yourself, else you would hate yourself with (all) your soul. You are assaulting yourself, O simpleton, like the lion who made a rush at himself. When you reach the bottom of your own nature, then you will know that that vileness was from yourself.",4
"At the bottom (of the well) it became manifest to the lion that he who seemed to him to be another was (really) his own image. Whoever tears out the teeth of a poor wretch is doing what the falsely-seeing lion did. O you who see the bad reflexion on the face of your uncle, it is not your uncle that is bad, it is you: do not run away from yourself! The Faithful are mirrors to one another: this saying is related from the Prophet. You held a blue glass before your eye: for that reason the world seemed to you to be blue.",4
"Unless you are blind, know that this blueness comes from yourself: speak ill of yourself, speak no more ill of any one (else). If the true believer was not seeing by the Light of God, how did things unseen appear naked (plainly revealed) to the true believer? Inasmuch as you were seeing by the Fire of God, you did not discern the difference between good and evil. Little by little throw water on the fire, that your fire may become light, O man of sorrow! Throw Thou, O Lord, the purifying water, that this world-fire may become wholly light.",4
"All the water of the sea is under Thy command; water and fire, O Lord, are Thine. If Thou willest, fire becomes sweet water; and if Thou willest not, even water becomes fire. This search (aspiration) in us is also brought into existence by Thee; deliverance from iniquity is Thy gift, O Lord. Without (our) seeking Thou hast given us this search, Thou hast given (us) gifts without number and (without) end. How the hare brought to the beasts of chase the news that the lion had fallen into the well. When the hare was gladdened by deliverance (from the lion), he began to run towards the beasts until (he came to) the desert.",4
"Having seen the lion miserably slain in the well, he was skipping joyously all the way to the meadow, Clapping his hands because he had escaped from the hand of Death; fresh and dancing in the air, like bough and leaf. Bough and leaf were set free from the prison of earth, lifted their heads, and became comrades of the wind; The leaves, when they had burst (forth from) the bough, made haste to reach the top of the tree; With the tongue of (seed that put forth) its sprouts each fruit and tree severally is singing thanks to God,",4
"Saying, “The Bounteous Giver nourished our root until the tree grew big and stood upright.” (Even so) the spirits bound in clay, when they escape glad at heart from their (prisons of) clay, Begin to dance in the air of Divine Love and become flawless like the full moon's orb, Their bodies dancing, and their souls—nay, do not ask (how their souls fare); and those things from which comes the soul's delight—nay, do not ask (of those things)! The hare lodged the lion in prison. Shame on a lion who was discomfited by a hare!",4
"He is in such a disgrace, and still—this is a wonder—he would fain be addressed by the title of Fakhr-i Dín. O thou lion that liest at the bottom of this lonely well, thy hare-like soul (nafs) has shed and drunk thy blood; Thy hare-soul is feeding in the desert, (whilst) thou art (lying) at the bottom of this well of “How?” and “Why?” That lion-catcher (the hare) ran towards the beasts, crying, “Rejoice, O people, since the announcer of joy is come. Glad news! Glad news, O company of merry-makers! That hell-hound has gone back to Hell.",4
"Glad news! Glad news! The enemy of your lives—his teeth have been torn out by the vengeance of his Creator. He who smote many heads with his claws—him too the broom of Death has swept away like rubbish.” How the beasts gathered round the hare and spoke in praise of him. Then all the wild beasts assembled, joyous and laughing gleefully in rapture and excitement. They formed a ring, he (the hare) in the midst like a candle: all the animals of the desert bowed (in homage) to him. “Art thou a heavenly angel or a peri? No, thou art the Azrael of fierce lions.",4
"Whatever thou art, our souls are offered in sacrifice to thee. Thou hast prevailed. Health to thy hand and arm! God turned this water into thy stream. Blessing on thy hand and arm! Explain how thou didst meditate with guile, and how thou didst guilefully wipe out that ruffian. Explain, in order that the tale may be the means of curing (our malady); explain, that it may be a salve for our souls. Explain! for in consequence of the iniquity of that tyrant our souls have myriads of wounds.”",4
"“O Sirs,” said he, “it was (by) God's aid; else, who in the world is a hare (who am I, that I should have been able to do this)? He (God) bestowed power on me and gave light to my heart: the light in my heart gave strength to hand and foot.” From God come preferments (to high position), from God also come changes (which bring one to low estate). God in (due) course and turn is ever displaying this (Divine) aid to doubters and seers (alike). Take heed! Do not exult in a kingdom bestowed in turns (passing from one to another). O thou who art the bondsman of Vicissitude, do not act as though thou wert free!",4
"(But) those for whom is prepared a kingdom beyond Vicissitude, for them the drums (of sovereignty) are beaten beyond the Seven Planets. Beyond Vicissitude are the kings everlasting: their spirits are circling with the Cupbearer perpetually. If thou wilt renounce this drinking (of worldly pleasures) for a day or two (for thy brief lifetime), thou wilt dip thy mouth in the drink of Paradise. Commentary on (the Tradition) “We have returned from the lesser Jihád to the greater Jihád.” O kings, we have slain the outward enemy, (but) there remains within (us) a worse enemy than he. To slay this (enemy) is not the work of reason and intelligence: the inward lion is not subdued by the hare. ",4
"This carnal self (nafs) is Hell, and Hell is a dragon (the fire of) which is not diminished by oceans (of water). It would drink up the Seven Seas, and still the blazing of that consumer of all creatures would not become less. Stones and stony-hearted infidels enter it, miserable and shamefaced, (But) still it is not appeased by all this food, until there comes to it from God this call— “Art thou filled, art thou filled?” It says, “Not yet; lo, here is the fire, here is the glow, here is the burning!”",4
"It made a mouthful of and swallowed a whole world, its belly crying aloud, “Is there any more?” God, from (the realm) where place is not, sets His foot on it: then it subsides at (the command) Be, and it was. Inasmuch as this self of ours is a part of Hell, and all parts have the nature of the whole, To God (alone) belongs this foot (power) to kill it: who, indeed, but God should draw its bow (vanquish it)? Only the straight arrow is put on the bow, (but) this bow (of the self) has (its) arrows bent back and crooked.",4
"Be straight, like an arrow, and escape from the bow, for without doubt every straight (arrow) will fly from the bow (to its mark). When I turned back from the outer warfare, I set my face towards the inner warfare. We have returned from the lesser Jihád, we are engaged along with the Prophet in the greater Jihád. I pray God to grant me strength and aid and (the right of) boasting, that I may root up with a needle this mountain of Qáf. Deem of small account the lion (champion) who breaks the ranks (of the enemy): the (true) lion is he that breaks (conquers) himself. How the ambassador of Rúm came to the Commander of the Faithful, ‘Umar, may God be well-pleased with him, and witnessed the gifts of grace with which ‘Umar, may God be well-pleased with him, was endowed.",4
"To ‘Umar in Medina there came through the wide desert an ambassador from the Emperor of Rúm. He said, “O ye attendants, where is the palace of the Caliph, that I may take thither my horse and baggage?” The folk said to him, “He has no palace: ‘Umar's (only) palace is an illumined spirit. Though he has a (great) renown from being Commander (of the Faithful), he has (no dwelling except) a hut, like the poor. O brother, how wilt thou behold his palace, when hair has grown in the eye of thy heart?",5
"Purge thy heart's eye of hair and defect, and then hope to behold his palace. Whoever hath a spirit purged of (sensual) desires will at once behold the Presence and the Holy Porch. When Mohammed was purged of this fire and smoke (of human passions), wheresoever he turned his face, was the Face of Allah. Inasmuch as thou art a friend to the evil suggestions of the malign one (Satan), how wilt thou know (the true meaning of) There is the Face of Allah? Every one in whose breast the gate is opened will behold from every city the sun (shining).",5
"God is manifest amongst others as the moon amidst the stars. Lay two finger-ends on thy two eyes, and wilt thou see aught of the world? Deal justly (confess that thou wilt see nothing). If thou dost not see this world, (yet) it is not non-existent: the fault lies not save in the finger of thy evil self. Come, lift the finger from thine eye, and then behold whatsoever thou wishest. To Noah his people said, ‘Where is the Divine recompense?’ He said, ‘On the other side of they cover themselves with their garments.",5
"Ye have wrapped your faces and heads in your clothes: of necessity ye have eyes and see not.’ Man is eye, and (all) the rest is (worthless) skin: the sight of that (eye) is (consists in) seeing the Beloved. When there is not sight of the Beloved, it (the eye) is better blind; the beloved who is not everlasting is better afar (away and out of sight).” When the ambassador of Rúm admitted these fresh (spiritual) words into his hearing (gave ear to them), he became more full of longing. He fixed his eye on seeking ‘Umar, he let his baggage and horse be lost.",5
"He was going in every direction after that man of (great) accomplishment, inquiring madly for him, Saying, “Can there be in the world such a man, and he be hid, like the spirit, from the world?” He sought him, that he might be as a slave to him: inevitably the seeker is a finder. An Arab woman of the desert saw that he was a stranger-guest. “Look,” said she, “there is ‘Umar under that palm. There he is under the palm-tree, apart from the people: behold the Shadow of God asleep in the shade!” How the ambassador of Rúm found the Commander of the Faithful, ‘Umar, may God be well-pleased with him, sleeping under the palm-tree.",5
"He came thither and stood afar off; he saw ‘Umar and fell a-trembling. An awe came upon the ambassador from that slumbering man, a sweet ecstasy lodged in his soul. Love and awe are contrary to each other: he saw these two contraries united in his heart. He said to himself: “I have seen (many) kings, I have been great (in esteem) and chosen (for honour) in the presence of sultans: I had no awe or dread of kings, (but) awe of this man has robbed me of my wits.",5
"I have gone into a jungle of lions and leopards, and my face did not change colour because of them; Often where the ranks are arrayed on the field of battle have I become (fierce) as a lion at the time when the affair is grievous (desperate); Many a heavy blow have I suffered and inflicted, I have been stouter in heart than (all) the others. This man is asleep on the earth, unarmed, (and yet) I am trembling in my seven limbs (my whole body): what is this? This is awe of God, it is not from created beings, it is not awe of this man who wears the frock of a dervish.",5
"Whoever is afraid of God and has chosen fear of God (as his religion), the Jinn and mankind and every one who sees (him) are afraid of him.” Thus meditating, he folded his hands reverently. After a while ‘Umar sprang up from sleep. How the ambassador of Rúm saluted the Commander of the Faithful, may God be well pleased with him. He did homage to ‘Umar and salaamed: the Prophet said, “(First) the salaam, then the talk.” Then he (‘Umar) said, “To thee (greeting),” called him (to come) forward, reassured him, and bade him sit down by his side. Fear ye not is the hospitality offered to those who fear: that is proper (entertainment) for one who is afraid.",5
"When any one is afraid, they make him (feel) secure; they soothe (his) fearful heart. How should you say “Fear not” to one who has no fear? Why give lessons (to him)? He needs no lessons. He (‘Umar) made that disturbed mind (be) of good cheer and made his desolate heart (be) flourishing (happy). Afterwards he addressed to him subtle discourses and (spoke) of the holy attributes of God—how good a Friend is He!— And of the loving kindnesses of God to the Abdál (saints), in order that he (the ambassador) might know (the meaning of) maqám (permanent station) and hál (passing state).",5
"The hál is like the unveiling of that beauteous bride, while the maqám is the (king's) being alone with the bride. The unveiling is witnessed by the king and by others as well, (but) at the time of being alone (with the bride) there is no one except the mighty king. The bride unveils before commons and nobles (alike); in the bridal chamber the king is (alone) with the bride. There is many a one of the Súfís who enjoys hál, (but) he that has attained to maqám is rare amongst them. He (‘Umar) reminded him of the stages traversed by the soul, and he reminded him of the journeys of the spirit,",5
"And of the Time which has (ever) been void of time, and of the Station of Holiness which has (ever) been majestical, And of the atmosphere wherein the Símurgh of the spirit, before this (material life), has flown and experienced (the bounty of Divine) grace, Every single flight thereof (being) greater than the horizons (of this world) and greater than the hope and greed of the longing lover. When ‘Umar found the stranger in appearance a friend (in reality), he found (that) his soul (was) seeking (to learn) the (Divine) mysteries. The Shaykh (‘Umar) was adept and the disciple (the ambassador) eager: the man (rider) was quick (dexterous) and the beast belonged to the royal court (was nobly bred and docile).",5
"That spiritual guide (‘Umar) perceived that he (the ambassador) possessed (the capacity for receiving) guidance: he sowed the good seed in the good soil. How the ambassador of Rúm questioned the Commander of the Faithful, may God be well-pleased with him. The man said to him, “O Commander of the Faithful, how did the spirit come to the earth from above? How did the infinite bird go into the cage?” He replied, “God recited spells and incantations over the spirit. When He recites spells over the non-existences which have no eye or ear, they begin to stir. Because of His spells the non-existences at that very moment are dancing joyously into existence.",5
"When, again, He recited a spell over the existent, at His word the existent marched (back) post-haste into non- existence. He spake into the ear of the rose and made it laughing (blooming); He spake to the stone and made it a cornelian of the mine. He spake to the body a sign (message), so that it became spirit; He spake to the sun, so that it became radiant. Again He puts into its ear a fearful saying, and upon the face of the sun fall a hundred eclipses.Consider what that Speaker chanted into the ear of the cloud, so that it poured tears from its eye, like a waterskin.",5
"Consider what God has chanted into the ear of the earth, so that it became regardful and has (ever since) remained silent.” Whosoever in perplexity is sorely troubled, God has spoken the riddle into his ear, That He may imprison him in two (doubtful) thoughts, (namely), “Shall I do what He told (me) or the contrary thereof?” From (the decree of) God also, one side obtains the preponderance, and from that (Divine) quarter he chooses one of the two (alternatives). If thou wouldst not have the mind of thy spirit in (a state of) perplexity, do not stuff this cotton-wool into thy spiritual ear,",5
"So that thou mayst understand those riddles of His, so that thou mayst apprehend (both) the secret sign and the open. Then the spiritual ear becomes the place where wahy (inspiration) descends. What is wahy? A speech hidden from sense- perception. The spiritual ear and eye are other than this sense-perception, the ear of (discursive) reason and the ear of opinion are destitute of this (inspiration). The word “compulsion” (jabr) made me impatient (uncontrollable) for love's sake, while it confined in (the prison of) compulsion him who is not a lover. This is union with God, and it is not compulsion: this is the shining forth of the moon, this is not a cloud.",5
"And if this be compulsion, it is not the compulsion of (suffered by) the vulgar: it is not the compulsion of (exerted by) the evil-commanding self-willed (soul). O son, (only) they know (the real meaning of) compulsion in whose hearts God has opened the sight (of the spiritual eye). To them the unseen things of the future became manifest; to them recollection of the past became naught. Their freewill and compulsion is different (from that of ordinary men): in oyster-shells drops (of rain) are pearls. Outside (of the shell) it is a drop of water, small or great, (but) within the shell it is a small or big pearl.",5
"Those persons have the nature of the muskdeer's gland: externally they are (as) blood, while within them is the fragrance of musk. Do not say, “This substance externally is blood: how should it become a musky perfume when it goes into the gland?” Do not say, “This copper externally was despicable: how should it assume nobility in the heart (midst) of the elixir?” In thee (the matter of) freewill and compulsion was a (mere) fancy, (but) when it went into them it became the light of (Divine) Majesty. When bread is (wrapped) in the tablecloth it is the inanimate thing (so-called), (but) in the human body it becomes the glad spirit (of life).",5
"It does not become transmuted in the heart of (within) the table-cloth: the (animal) soul transmutes it with (the water of) Salsabíl. O thou who readest aright, such is the power of the soul: what, then, must be the power of that Soul of soul? The piece of flesh which is Man, endowed with intelligence and soul, cleaves mountain and sea and mine. The strength of the mountain-riving soul is (shown in) the splitting of rocks; the strength of the Soul of soul in the moon wassplit asunder. If the heart should open the lid of the wallet of (this) mystery, the soul would rush (in rapture) towards the highest heaven. How Adam imputed that fault (which he had committed) to himself, saying, “O Lord, we have done wrong,” and how Iblís imputed his own sin to God, saying, “Because Thou hast seduced me.”",5
"Consider both our action and the action of God. Regard our action as existent. This is manifest. If the action of created beings be not in the midst (obviously existent), then say not to any one, “Why have you acted thus? The creative act of God brings our actions into existence: our actions are the effects of the creative act of God. A rational being perceives either the letter (the outer sign) or the (inner) purpose (the spirit): how should he comprehend two accidents at once? If he goes (turns his mind) to the spirit, he becomes unheedful of the letter: no eye sees forward and backward at the same moment.",5
"At the time when you look in front, how at the same time can you look behind you? Recognise this. Inasmuch as the soul does not comprehend (both) the letter and the spirit, how should the soul be the creator of them both? O son, (only) God comprehends both: the (one) action does not hinder Him from the other action. Satan said Because Thou hast seduced me: the vile Devil concealed his own act. Adam said We have done wrong unto ourselves: he was not, like us, unheedful of the action of God.",5
"From respect he concealed it (the action of God) in (regard to) the sin: by casting the sin upon himself he ate fruit (was blessed). After his repentance, He (God) said to him, “O Adam, did not I create in thee that sin and (those) tribulations? Was it not My foreordainment and destiny? How didst thou conceal that at the time of excusing thyself?” He (Adam) said, “I was afraid, (so) I did not let respect go (did not fail to observe due respect).” He (God) said, “I too have observed it towards thee.” Whoever brings reverence gets reverence (in return): whoever brings sugar eats almond-cake.",5
"For whom are the good women? For the good men. Treat thy friend with honour; offend (him) and see (what will happen). O heart, bring (forward) a parable for the sake of (illustrating) a difference, that thou mayst know (what distinguishes) compulsion from freewill. (Take the case of) a hand that is shaking from (morbid or involuntary) tremor and (the case of) a person whose hand you cause to shake (by knocking it away) from its place. Know that both (these) movements are created by God, but it is impossible to compare the latter with the former. You are sorry for having caused it (his hand) to shake: how is the man afflicted with (a morbid) tremor not sorry?",5
"This is the intellectual quest. What is (the use of such a) quest, O ingenious one? That perchance (by its means) a man of weak understanding may find his way to that place (gain some idea of the truth). (Yet) the intellectual quest, though it be (fine as) pearls and coral, is other than the spiritual quest. The spiritual quest is on another plane: the spiritual wine has another consistency. At the time when the intellectual quest was in keeping (with the circumstances), this ‘Umar was intimate with Bu ’l-Hakam, (But) when ‘Umar went away from intellect towards spirit, Bu ’l-Hakam became Bú Jahl (the father of ignorance) in searching into that (subject).",5
"He is perfect on the side of sense-perception and understanding, though indeed he is ignorant in regard to the spirit. Know that the quest of the intellect and the senses is (concerned with) effects or secondary causes. The spiritual quest is eitherwonder or the father of wonder (either wonderful or beyond wonder). The illumination of the spirit comes: (then) there remains not, O thou who seekest illumination, conclusion and premise or that which contradicts (a statement) (or) that which renders (its acceptance) necessary, Because the seer on whom His (God's) Light is dawning is quite independent of the (logical) proof which resembles a (blind man's) staff. Once more we come back to the tale: when, indeed, did we go forth from the tale? Commentary on “And He is with you wheresoever ye be.”",5
"If we come to ignorance, that is His prison, and if we come to knowledge, that is His palace; And if we come to sleep, we are His intoxicated ones; and if to wakefulness, we are in His hands; And if we weep, we are a cloud laden with the bounty dispensed by Him; and if we laugh, at that time we are His lightning; And if (we come) to wrath and war, ’tis the reflexion of His Might; and if to peace and forgiveness, ’tis the reflexion of His Love. Who are we? In this tangled (complex) world what (thing other than He) indeed hath He (who is single) like alif? Nothing, nothing. How the ambassador asked ‘Umar, may God be well-pleased with him, concerning the cause of the tribulation suffered by spirits in these bodies of clay.",5
"He said, “O ‘Umar, what was the wisdom and mystery of imprisoning that pure one (the spirit) in this dirty place? The pure water has become hidden in mud: the pure spirit has become bound in bodies.” He (‘Umar) said, “Thou art making a profound inquiry, thou art confining a meaning in a word. Thou hast imprisoned the free (unconditioned) meaning, thou hast bound the wind in a word. This thou hast done for a benefit (good purpose), O thou who thyself art blind to the benefit (good purpose) of God.",5
"He from whom (every) benefit was born, how should He not see that which was seen by us? There are myriads of benefits, and every myriad is (but) a few beside that one. The breath of thy speech, which is a part of the parts (bodily members), became beneficial: why (then) is the whole of the whole (the universal connexion of spirit and body) devoid (of benefit)? Thou who art a part—thy act (of speaking) is beneficial: why (then) dost thou lift thy hand to assail the whole? If there is no benefit in speech, do not speak; and if there is, leave off making objections, and endeavour to give thanks.”",5
"Thanksgiving to God is a collar on every neck (every one's duty); it is not (thanksgiving) to dispute and make one's face look sour. If thanksgiving is only to look sour, then there is no thanks-giver like vinegar. If vinegar wants (to find) the way to the liver, let it become oxymel by (being mixed with) sugar. The meaning in poetry has no sureness of direction: it is like the sling, it is not under control. On the inner sense of “Let him who desires to sit with God sit with the Súfís.” The ambassador became beside himself from these one or two cups (of spiritual discourse): neither embassage nor message remained in his memory.",5
"He became distraught at the power of God. The ambassador arrived at this place (state) and became a king. When the torrent reached the sea, it became the sea; when the seed reached the cornland, it became the crop of corn. When the bread attained to connexion with the animal (man), the dead bread became living and endowed with knowledge. When the wax and firewood were devoted to the fire, their dark essence became (filled with) light. When the (powdered) stone of antimony went into the eyes, it turned to sight and there became a scout (one who observes the enemy from some point of vantage).",5
"Oh, happy is the man who was freed from himself and united with the existence of a living one! Alas for the living one who consorted with the dead! He became dead, and life sped away from him. When you have fled (for refuge) to the Qur’án of God, you have mingled with the spirit of the prophets. The Qur’án is (a description of) the states of the prophets, (who are) the fishes of the holy sea of (Divine) Majesty. And if you read and do not accept (take to heart) the Qur’án, suppose you have seen the prophets and saints (what will that avail you?);",5
"But if you are accepting (the Qur’án), when you read the stories (of the prophets), the bird, your soul, will be distressed in its cage. The bird that is a prisoner in a cage, (if it) is not seeking to escape, ’tis from ignorance. The spirits which have escaped from their cages are the prophets, (those) worthy guides. From without comes their voice, (telling) of religion, (and crying), “This, this is the way of escape for thee. By this we escaped from this narrow cage: there is no means of escape from this cage but this way,",5
"(That) thou shouldst make thyself ill, exceedingly wretched, in order that thou mayst be let out from (the cage of) reputation.” Worldly reputation is a strong chain: in the Way how is this less than a chain of iron? The story of the merchant to whom the parrot gave a message for the parrots of India on the occasion of his going (thither) to trade. There was a merchant, and he had a parrot imprisoned in a cage, a pretty parrot. When the merchant made ready for travel and was about to depart to India, Because of his generosity he said to each male slave and each handmaid, “What shall I bring (home) for you? Tell (me) quickly.”",5
"Because it is dark, and on every side are fields of cotton: how should sparks be amongst cotton? Iniquitous are those persons who shut their eyes and by such (vain) words set a whole world ablaze. A single word lays waste a (whole) world, turns dead foxes into lions. Spirits in their original nature have the (life-giving) breath of Jesus, (but while they remain embodied) one breath of it (the spirit) is a wound, and the other a plaster. If the (bodily) screen were removed from the spirits, the speech of every spirit would be like (the breath of) the Messiah.",6
"If you wish to utter words like sugar, refrain from concupiscence and do not eat this sweetmeat (the desires of the flesh). Self-control is the thing desired by the intelligent; sweetmeat is what children long for. Whoever practises self-control ascends to Heaven, whoever eats sweetmeat falls farther behind. Commentary on the saying of Farídu’ddín ‘Attár, may God sanctify his spirit— “Thou art a sensualist: O heedless one, drink blood (mortify thyself) amidst the dust (of thy bodily existence), For if thespiritualist drink a poison, it will be (to him as) an antidote.” It does not harm the spiritualist (saint) though he drink deadly poison for all to see, Because he has attained to (spiritual) health and has been set free from (the need for) abstinence, (while) the poor seeker (of God) is (still) in the (state of) fever.",6
"The Prophet said, “O bold seeker, beware! Do not contend with any one who is sought.” In thee is a Nimrod: do not go into the fire. If thou wish to go in, first become Abraham! When thou art neither a swimmer nor a seaman, do not cast thyself (into the sea) from a (feeling of) self-conceit. He (the saint) fetches pearls from the bottom of the sea, from losses he brings gain to the surface. If a perfect man (saint) take earth, it becomes gold; if an imperfect one has carried away gold, it becomes ashes.",6
"Since that righteous man is accepted of God, his hand in (all) things is the hand of God. The hand of the imperfect man is the hand of Devil and demon, because he is in the trap of imposition and guile. If ignorance come to him (the perfect man), it becomes knowledge, (but) the knowledge that goes into the imperfect man becomes ignorance. Whatever an ill man takes becomes illness, (but) if a perfect man takes infidelity, it becomes religion. O thou who, being on foot, hast contended with a horseman, thou wilt not save thy head. Now hold thy foot (desist)! How the magicians paid respect to Moses, on whom be peace, saying, “What dost thou command? Wilt thou cast down thy rod first, or shall we?”",6
"The magicians in the time of the accursed Pharaoh, when they contended with Moses in enmity, Yet gave Moses the precedence—the magicians held him in honour— Because they said to him, “’Tis for thee to command: (if) thou wishest to be the first, do thou cast down thy rod first (of all).” “Nay,” said he, “first do ye, O magicians, cast down those tricks (objects of enchantment) into the middle (where all can see them).” This amount of respect purchased their (belief in) (the true) religion, so that it (the true belief) cut off the hands and feet of their contention (prevented them from disputing further with Moses).",6
"When the magicians acknowledged his (Moses') right, they sacrificed their hands and feet (as a penance) for the sin of that (contention). To the perfect man (every) mouthful (of food) and (every) saying is lawful. Thou art not perfect: do not eat, be mute, Inasmuch as thou art an ear and he a tongue, not thy congener: God said to the ears, “Be silent.” When the sucking babe is born, at first it keeps silence for a while, it is all ear. For a while it must close its lips (and refrain) from speech, until it learns to speak;",6
"And if it is not (silent like) an ear but makes babbling sounds, it makes itself the dumbest creature in the world. He that is deaf by nature, he that had no ear at the beginning, is dumb: how should he burst into speech? Since, in order to speak, one must first hear, do thou come to speech by the way of hearing. Enter ye the houses by their doors, and seek ye the ends in their causes. There is no speech independent of the way of hearing except the speech of the Creator who is without want.",6
"He is the Originator, He follows no master; He is the support of all things, He hath no support, (While) the rest, (engaged) in handicrafts and talk, follow a master and have need of a pattern. If thou art not alien to (unfit to hear) this discourse, assume the frock of a dervish and (take to shedding) tears in some deserted place, Because Adam by means of tears escaped from that reproof: moist tears are the breath (speech) of the penitent. For weeping's sake Adam came (down) to the earth, that he might be weeping and moaning and sorrowful.",6
"Adam, (cast out) from Paradise and from above the Seven (Heavens), went to the “shoe-row” for the purpose of excusing himself. If thou art from the back of Adam and from his loins, be constant in seeking (forgiveness) amongst his company.Prepare a dessert of heart-fire (burning grief) and eye-water (tears): the garden is made open (blooming) by cloud and sun. What dost thou know of the taste of the water of the eyes? Thou art a lover of bread, like the blind (beggars). If thou make this wallet empty of bread, thou wilt make it full of glorious jewels.",6
"Wean the babe, thy soul, from the Devil's milk, and after that make it consort with the Angel. Whilst thou art dark and vexed and gloomy, know that thou art sucking from the same breast as the accursed Devil. The mouthful that gave increase of light and perfection is obtained from lawful earnings. The oil that comes and quenches our lamp—when it quenches a lamp, call it water. From the lawful morsel are born knowledge and wisdom; from the lawful morsel come love and tenderness.",6
"When from a morsel thou seest (arise) envy and guile, (and when) ignorance and heedlessness are born (of it), know that it is unlawful. Wilt thou sow wheat and will it produce barley? Hast thou seen a mare bring forth an ass's colt? The morsel is seed, and thoughts are its fruit; the morsel is the sea, and thoughts are its pearls. From the lawful morsel in the mouth is born the inclination to serve (God) and the resolve to go to yonder world. How the merchant related to the parrot what he had witnessed on the part of the parrots of India. The merchant finished his trading and returned home glad at heart.",6
"He brought a present for every male slave, he gave a token to every slave-girl. “Where is my present?” asked the parrot. “Relate what thou hast said and seen.” “Nay,” said he, “indeed I am repenting of that (which I said), gnawing my hand and biting my fingers (in remorse). Why, from ignorance and folly, did I idly bear (such) an inconsiderate message?” “O master,” said the parrot, “what is thy repentance for? What is it that causes this anger and grief?”",6
"“I told thy complaints,” said he, “to a company of parrots resembling thee. One parrot got scent of (understood) thy pain: her heart broke, and she trembled and died. I became sorry, (thinking) ‘why did I say this?’ but what was the use of repenting after I had said it?” Know that a word which suddenly shot from the tongue is like an arrow shot from the bow. O son, that arrow does not turn back on its way: you must dam a torrent at the source.",6
"When it left the source behind, it swept over a world (of country): if it lays waste the world, ’tis no wonder. There is an unseen bringing forth of effects to (our) action, and the results born of it are not in the control of (human) creatures: Those results are all created by God without any partner, though they are imputed to us. Zayd let fly an arrow in the direction of ‘Amr: his arrow gripped ‘Amr like a leopard. During a long time, a (whole) year, it was producing pain: pains are created by God, not by man.",6
"If Zayd who shot (the arrow) died of fright at the moment (when ‘Amr was wounded), (nevertheless) pains are continually being produced there (in ‘Amr's body) until (‘Amr's) death. Inasmuch as he (‘Amr) died from the results of the hurt (inflicted on him), for this cause call Zayd, who shot (the arrow), the murderer. Impute those pains to him, though all of them are the work of the Creator. So with sowing and breathing (speaking) and (laying) snares and sexual intercourse: the results of those (actions) are amenable to (determined by the will of) God. The saints possess power (derived) from God: they turn back from its course the arrow that has sped.",6
"When the saint repents, he closes the doors of the results (shuts off the results) from the cause by that hand (power) of the Lord. Through the opening of the door (of Divine grace), he makes unsaid what has been said, so that neither spit nor roast-meat is burnt thereby. He wipes out the saying from all the minds that heard it, and makes it imperceptible. O sire, if thou must needs have demonstration and proof (of this), recite “(Whatever) verse (We cancel) or cause to be forgotten. ” Read the verse “They made you forget My warning”: acknowledge their (the saints') power to put forgetfulness (in men's hearts).",6
"Since they are able to make (you) remember and forget, they are mighty over all the hearts of (God's) creatures. When he (the saint) has blocked the road of (your) mental perception by means of forgetfulness, it is impossible (for you) to act, even if there be virtue (in you). Think ye those exalted ones are a laughing-stock? Recite from the Qur’án as far as (the words) “They made you forget.” He that owns a village is king over bodies; he that owns a heart is king over your hearts. Without any doubt, action (practice) is a branch of (subordinate to) seeing (theory): therefore Man is nothing but “the little man” (the pupil of the eye).",6
"I dare not expound the whole of this (subject): hindrance thereto is coming from those who are at the centre. Inasmuch as the forgetfulness and recollection of (God's) creatures are with him (depend on the perfect saint), and he comes at their call for help, Every night that glorious one is emptying from their hearts hundreds of thousands of good and evil (thoughts), (While) in the daytime he is filling their hearts therewith— he is filling those oystershells with pearls. By (Divine) guidance (after sleep is past) all those thoughts of former things recognize the spirits (to which they were attached).",6
"Your handicraft and skill come (back) to you, that they may open to you the door of (ways and) means. The goldsmith's craft did not go to the ironsmith; the disposition of the good-natured man did not go to the disagreeable one. On the day of Resurrection the handicrafts and dispositions will come, like articles of property, to the claimant (owner). After sleep also, the handicrafts and dispositions come back in haste to him that claims them as his. At the hour of dawn the handicrafts and thoughts went to the same place where that good and evil (formerly) were.",6
"Like carrier pigeons, they bring things useful (to know) from (other) cities to their own city. How the parrot heard what those parrots had done, and died in the cage, and how the merchant made lament for her.When the bird heard what that (other) parrot had done, she trembled exceedingly, fell, and became cold. The merchant, seeing her thus fallen, sprang up and dashed his cap on the ground. When he saw her in this guise and in this state, the merchant sprang forward and tore the breast of his garment. He said, “O beautiful parrot with thy sweet cry, what is this that has happened to thee? Why hast thou become like this?",6
"Oh, alas for my sweet-voiced bird! Oh, alas for my bosom-friend and confidant! Oh, alas for my melodious bird, the wine of my spirit and my garden and my sweet basil! Had Solomon possessed a bird like this, how indeed should he have become occupied with those (other) birds? Oh, alas for the bird which I gained cheaply, and (so) soon turned my face away from her countenance! O tongue, thou art a great damage to me, (but) since thou art speaking, what should I say to thee?",6
"O tongue, thou art both the fire and the stack: how long wilt thou dart this fire upon this stack? Secretly my soul is groaning because of thee, although it is doing whatsoever thou biddest it. O tongue, thou art a treasure without end. O tongue, thou art also a disease without remedy. Thou art at once a whistle and decoy for birds, and a comforter in the desolation of absence (from the Beloved). How long wilt thou grant me mercy, O merciless one, O thou who hast drawn the bow to take vengeance on me?",6
"Lo, thou hast made my bird fly away. Do not browse (any more) in the pasture of injustice! Either answer me or give redress or mention to me (what will be) the means of (producing) joy. Oh, alas for my darkness-consuming dawn! Oh, alas for my day-enkindling light! Oh, alas for my bird of goodly flight, that has flown from my end (my last state) to my beginning (my first state). The ignorant man is in love with pain unto everlasting. Arise and read (in the Qur’án) I swear as far as (the words) in trouble.",6
"With thy face I was free from trouble, and in thy river I was unsoiled by froth. These cries of ‘Alas’ are (caused by) the phantasy (idea) of seeing (the Beloved) and (by) separation from my present existence. ’Twas the jealousy of God, and there is no device against God: where is a heart that is not (shattered) in a hundred pieces by God's love? The jealousy (of God) is this, that He is other than all things, that He is beyond explanation and the noise of words. Oh, alas! Would that my tears were an ocean, that they might be strewn as an offering to the fair charmer!",6
"My parrot, my clever-headed bird, the interpreter of my thought and inmost consciousness, She has told me from the first, that I might remember it, whatsoever should come to me as my allotted portion of right and wrong.” The parrot whose voice comes from (Divine) inspiration and whose beginning was before the beginning of existence— That parrot is hidden within thee: thou hast seen the reflexion of her upon this and that (the things of the phenomenal world). She takes away thy joy, and because of her thou art rejoicing: thou receivest injury from her as though it were justice.",6
"O thou who wert burning the soul for the body's sake, thou hast burned (destroyed) the soul and illumined (delighted) the body. I am burning (with love of God): does any one want tinder, let him set his rubbish ablaze with fire from me. Inasmuch as tinder is combustible, take tinder that catches fire (readily). O alas, O alas, O alas that such a moon became hidden under the clouds! How should I utter a word?—for the fire in my heart is grown fierce, the lion of separation (from the Beloved) has become raging and blood-shedding.",6
"One that even when sober is violent and furious, how will it be when he takes the wine-cup in his hand? The furious Lion who is beyond description is too great for (cannot be contained in) the wide expanse of the meadow. I am thinking of rhymes, and my Sweetheart says to me, “Do not think of aught except vision of Me. Sit at thy ease, My rhyme-meditating (friend): in My presence thou art rhymed with (attached to) felicity. What are words that thou shouldst think of them? What are words? Thorns in the hedge of the vineyard.",6
"I will throw word and sound and speech into confusion, that without these three I may converse with thee. That word which I kept hidden from Adam I will speak to thee, O (thou who art the) consciousness of the world. (I will tell to thee) that word which I did not communicate to Abraham, and that pain (love) which Gabriel does not know.” That word of which the Messiah (Jesus) breathed not a word God, from jealousy, did not utter even without má. What is má in language? Positive and negative. I am not positive, I am selfless and negated.",6
"I found (true) individuality in non-individuality: therefore I wove (my) individuality into non-individuality. All kings are enslaved to their slaves, all people are dead (ready to die) for one who dies for them. All kings are prostrate before one who is prostrate before them, all people are intoxicated with (love for) one who is intoxicated with them. The fowler becomes a prey to the birds in order that of a sudden he may make them his prey. The hearts of heart-ravishers are captivated by those who have lost their hearts (to them): all loved ones are the prey of (their) lovers.",6
"Whomsoever thou didst deem to be a lover, regard (him) as the loved one, for relatively he is both this and that. If they that are thirsty seek water from the world, (yet) water too seeks in the world them that are thirsty. Inasmuch as He is (thy) lover, do thou be silent: as He is pulling thine ear, be thou (all) ear. Dam the torrent (of ecstasy) when it runs in flood; else it will work shame and ruin. What care I though ruin be (wrought)? Under the ruin there is a royal treasure.",6
"He that is drowned in God wishes to be more drowned, (while) his spirit (is tossed) up and down like the waves of the sea, (Asking), “Is the bottom of the sea more delightful, or the top? Is His (the Beloved's) arrow more fascinating, or the shield?” O heart, thou art torn asunder by evil suggestion if thou recognise any difference between joy and woe. Although the object of thy desire has the taste of sugar, is not absence of any object of desire (in thee) the object of the Beloved's desire? Every star of His is the blood-price of a hundred new moons: it is lawful for Him to shed the blood of the (whole) world.",6
"We gained the price and the blood-price: we hastened to gamble our soul away. Oh, the life of lovers consists in death: thou wilt not win the (Beloved's) heart except in losing thine own. I sought (to win) His heart with a hundred airs and graces, (but) He made excuses to me (put me off) in disdain. I said, “After all, this mind and soul (of mine) are drowned in Thee.” “Begone,” said He, “begone! Do not chant these spells over Me (do not seek thus to beguile Me). Do not I know what thought thou hast conceived? O thou who hast seen double, how hast thou regarded the Beloved?",6
"O gross-spirited one, thou hast held Me in light esteem, because thou hast bought Me very cheaply. He that buys cheaply gives cheaply: a child will give a pearl for a loaf of bread.” I am drowned in a love (so deep) that therein are drowned the first loves and the last. I have told it summarily, I have not explained it (at length), otherwise both (thy) perceptions and (my) tongue would be consumed. When I speak of “lip,” ’tis the lip (shore) of the Sea; when I say “not,” the intended meaning is “except.”",6
"By reason of (inward) sweetness I sit with sour face: from fullness of speech I am silent, That in the mask of sour-facedness my sweetness may be kept hidden from the two worlds. In order that this subject may not come to every ear, I am telling (only) one out of a hundred esoteric mysteries. Commentary on the saying of the Hakím (Saná’í): “Any thing that causes thee to be left behind on the Way, what matterwhether it be infidelity or faith? Any form that causes thee to fall far from the Beloved, what matter whether it be ugly orbeautiful?”—and (a discourse) on the meaning of the words of the Prophet, on whom be peace: “Verily, Sa‘d is jealous,and I am more jealous than Sa‘d, and Allah is more jealous than I; and because of His jealousy He hath forbidden foulactions both outward and inward. The whole world became jealous because God is superior to all the world in jealousy. He is like the spirit, and the world is like the body: the body receives from the spirit (both) good and evil.",6
"Any one whose prayer-niche is turned to the (mystical) revelation, do thou regard his going (back) to (the traditional) faith as shameful. Any one who has become Master of the robes to the King, it is loss for him to traffic on the King's behalf. Any one who becomes the intimate friend of the Sultan, it is an injury and swindle (for him) to wait at his door. When (the privilege of) kissing the (King's) hand has been bestowed on him by the King, it is a sin if he prefers to kiss the (King's) foot. Although to lay the head on the (King's) foot is an act of obeisance, (yet) compared with the former act of obeisance it is a fault and backsliding.",6
"The King is jealous of any one who, after having seen the face, prefers the (mere) scent. To speak in parables, God's jealousy is the wheat, (while) men's jealousy is the straw in the stack. Know that the root of (all) jealousies is in God: those of mankind are an offshoot from God, without resemblance (being implied). I will leave the explanation of this and will begin to complain of the cruelty of that fickle Beauty. I wail because wailings are pleasant to Him: He wants from the two worlds wailing and grief.",6
"How should I not wail bitterly on account of His deceit, since I am not in the circle of those intoxicated with Him? How should I not mourn, like night, without His day and without the favour of His day-illuming countenance? His unsweetness is sweet in my soul: may my soul be sacrificed to the Beloved who grieves my heart! I am in love with my grief and pain for the sake of pleasing my peerless King. I make the dust of sorrow a salve for mine eye, that the two seas of mine eyes may be filled with pearls.",6
"The tears which people shed for His sake are pearls—and people think they are tears. I am complaining of the Soul of the soul, (but in truth) I am not complaining: I am (only) relating. My heart is saying, “I am tormented by Him,” and I have (long) been laughing at its poor pretence. Do (me) right, O glory of the righteous, O Thou who art the dais, and I the threshold of Thy door! Where are threshold and dais in reality? In the quarter where our Beloved is, where are “we” and “I”?",6
"O Thou whose soul is free from “we” and “I,” O Thou who art the subtle essence of the spirit in man and woman, When man and woman become one, Thou art that One; when the units are wiped out, lo, Thou art that (Unity). Thou didst contrive this “I” and “we” in order that Thou mightst play the game of worship with Thyself, That all “I's” and “thou's” should become one soul and at last should be submerged in the Beloved. All this is (true), and do Thou come, O (Lord of the) Creative Word, O Thou who transcendest “Come” and (all) speech!",6
"The body can see Thee (only) in bodily fashion: it fancies (pictures to itself) Thy sadness or laughter. Do not say that the heart that is bound (conditioned) by (such bodily attributes as) sadness and laughter is worthy of seeing Thee (as Thou really art). He who is bound by sadness and laughter is living by means of these two borrowed (transient and unreal) things. In the verdant garden of Love, which is without end, there are many fruits besides sorrow and joy. Love is higher than these two states of feeling: without spring and without autumn it is (ever) green and fresh.",6
"Pay the tithe on Thy fair face, O Beauteous One: relate the story of the soul that is rent in pieces, For by the coquetry of a glance One who is given to glancing amorously has branded my heart anew. I absolved Him if He shed my blood: I was saying, “It is lawful (I absolve Thee),” and He was fleeing (from me). Since Thou art fleeing from the lament of those who are (as) dust, why pourest Thou sorrow on the hearts of the sorrowful? O Thou, whom every dawn that shone from the East found overflowing (with abundant grace) like the bright fountain (of the sun),",6
"How didst Thou give (nothing but) evasion to Thy frenzied lover, O Thou the sugar of whose lips hath no price? O Thou who art a new soul to the old world, hear the cry (that comes) from my body (which is) without soul and heart. Leave the tale of the Rose! For God's sake set forth the tale of the Nightingale that is parted from the Rose! Our emotion is not caused by grief and joy, our consciousness is not related to fancy and imagination. There is another state (of consciousness), which is rare: do not thou disbelieve, for God is very mighty.",6
"Do not judge from the (normal) state of man, do not abide in wrong-doing and in well-doing. Wrong-doing and well-doing, grief and joy, are things that come into existence; those who come into existence die; God is their heir. ’Tis dawn. O Thou who art the support and refuge of the dawn, ask pardon (for me) of my Lord Husámu’ddín! Thou art He who asketh pardon of the Universal Mind and Soul, Thou art the Soul of the soul and the Splendour of the coral. The light of dawn has shone forth, and from Thy light we are engaged in drinking the morning-drink with the wine of Thy Mansúr.",6
"Inasmuch as Thy gift keeps me thus (enravished), who (what) is (other) wine that it should bring me rapture? Wine in ferment is a beggar suing for our ferment; Heaven in revolution is a beggar suing for our consciousness. Wine became intoxicated with us, not we with it; the body came into being from us, not we from it. We are as bees, and bodies are as wax (honeycomb): we have made the body, cell by cell, like wax. This (discourse) is very long. Tell the story of the merchant, that we may see what happened to that good man. Reverting to the tale of the merchant who went to trade (in India).",6
"The merchant in fire (burning grief) and anguish and yearning was uttering a hundred distracted phrases like this, Now self-contradiction, now disdain, now supplication, now passion for reality, now metaphor (unreality). The drowning man suffers an agony of soul and clutches at every straw. For fear of (losing) his head (life), he flings about (both) hand and foot to see whether any one will take his hand (help him) in peril. The Friend loves this agitation: it is better to struggle vainly than to lie still.",6
"He who is the King (of all) is not idle, (though) complaint from Him would be a marvel, for He is not ill. For this reason said the Merciful (God), O son, “Every day He is (busy) in an affair,” O son. In this Way be thou ever scraping and scratching (exerting thyself to the utmost): until thy last breath do not be unoccupied for a moment, So that thy last breath may be a last breath in which the (Divine) favour is thy bosomfriend. Whatsoever the soul which is in man and woman strives to do, the ear and eye of the soul's King are at the window. How the merchant cast the parrot out of the cage and how the dead parrot flew away.",6
"After that, he cast her out of the cage. The little parrot flew to a lofty bough. The dead parrot made such a (swift) flight as when the orient sun rushed onward. The merchant was amazed at the action of the bird: without understanding he suddenly beheld the mysteries of the bird. He lifted up his face and said, “O nightingale, give us profit (instruction) by explaining thy case. What did she (the parrot) do there (in India), that thou didst learn, devise a trick, and burn us (with grief)”?",6
"The parrot said, “She by her act counselled me—‘Abandon thy charm of voice and thy affection (for thy master), Because thy voice has brought thee into bondage’: she feigned herself dead for the sake of (giving me) this counsel, Meaning (to say), ‘O thou who hast become a singer to high and low, become dead like me, that thou mayst gain release.’” If you are a grain, the little birds will peck you up; if you are a bud, the children will pluck you off. Hide the grain (bait), become wholly a snare; hide the bud, become the grass on the roof.",6
"Any one who offers his beauty to auction, a hundred evil fates set out towards him (and overtake him). Plots and angers and envies pour upon his head, like water from waterskins. Foes tear him to pieces from jealousy; even friends take his lifetime away. He that was heedless of the sowing and the springtide, how should he know the value of this lifetime? You must flee to the shelter of God's grace, who shed thousand fold grace upon (our) spirits,",6
"That you may find a shelter. Then how (will you lack) shelter? Water and fire will become your army. Did not the sea become a friend to Noah and Moses? Did it not become overbearing in vengeance against their enemies? Was not the fire a fortress for Abraham, so that it raised smoke (sighs of despair) from the heart of Nimrod? Did not the mountain call Yahyá (John the Baptist) to itself and drive off his pursuers with blows of stone? “O Yahyá,” it said, “come, take refuge in me, that I may be thy shelter from the sharp sword.” How the parrot bade farewell to the merchant and flew away.",6
"The parrot gave him one or two counsels full of (spiritual) savour and after that bade him the farewell of parting. The merchant said to her, “Go, God protect thee! Just now thou hast shown to me a new Way.” Said the merchant to himself, “This is the counsel for me; I will take her Way, for this Way is shining with light. How should my soul be meaner than the parrot? The soul ought to follow a good track like this.” The harmfulness of being honoured by the people and of becoming conspicuous. The body is cage-like: the body, amidst the cajoleries of those who come in and go out, became a thorn to the soul.",6
"This one says to him, “I will be thy confidant,” and that one says, “Nay, I am thy partner.” This one says to him, “There is none in existence like thee for beauty and eminence and for kindness and liberality.” That one says to him, “Both the worlds are thine, all our souls are thy soul's parasites.” When he sees the people intoxicated with (desire for) him, because of arrogance he loses self-control. He does not know that the Devil has cast thousands like him into the water of the river (of destruction).",6
"The world's flattery and hypocrisy is a sweet morsel: eat less of it (eat it not), for it is a morsel full of fire. Its fire is hidden and its taste is manifest: its smoke becomes visible in the end. Do not say, “How should I swallow that praise? He is speaking from desire (for reward): I am on his track (and see quite well what he is after).” If your belauder should satirise you in public, your heart would burn for (many) days on account of those scorches (of vituperation). Although you know that he (only) said it in disappointment because the hopes he had of you brought him no gain,",6
"(Yet) the effect thereof is remaining within you. The same experience happens to you in the case of praise. The effect of that too lasts for many days and becomes a source of arrogance and deception of the soul, But it does not show itself, because praise is sweet; (in the case of blame) the evil shows itself, because blame is bitter. It (blame) is like (bitter) decoctions and pills which you swallow and for a long time you are in disturbance and pain, Whereas, if you eat halwá (sweetmeat), its taste is momentary: this effect, like the other, is not enduring for ever.",6
"Since it does not endure (perceptibly), it endures imperceptibly: recognise every opposite by means of its opposite. When the effect of sugar endures (remains latent), after a while it produces boils that call for the lancet. Pharaoh was made (what he was) by abundance of praises: be lowly of spirit through meekness, do not domineer. So far as you can, become a slave, do not be a monarch. Suffer blows: become like the ball, do not be the bat. Otherwise, when this elegance and beauty remains with you no more, you will be loathed by those companions.",6
"The set of people who used to flatter you deceitfully, when they behold you will call you a devil. When they see you at their doors, they all will cry, “A dead man has risen from his grave.” (You will be) like the beardless youth whom they address as “Lord” that by this hypocrisy they may make him infamous. As soon as he has grown a beard in infamy, the Devil is ashamed to search after him. The Devil approaches Man for the sake of wickedness: he does not approach you because you are worse than the Devil.",6
"So long as you were a man the Devil was running at your heels and bidding you taste (his) wine. Since you have become confirmed in devilry, the Devil is fleeing from you, O good for- nothing! At that (former) time they clung to your skirt: when you became like this they all fled. Explanation of (the Tradition) “Whatsoever God wills cometh to pass.” We have spoken all these words, but in preparing ourselves (for the journey before us) we are naught, naught without the favours of God. Without the favours of God and God's elect ones, angel though he be, his page is black.",6
"O God, O Thou whose bounty fulfils (every) need, it is not allowable to mention any one beside Thee. This amount of guidance Thou hast bestowed (upon us); till this (present time) Thou hast covered up many a fault of ours. Cause the drop of knowledge which Thou gavest (us) heretofore to become united with Thy seas. In my soul there is a drop of knowledge: deliver it from sensuality and from the body's clay, Before these clays drink it up, before these winds sweep it away,",6
"Although, when they sweep it away, Thou art able to take it back from them and redeem it. The drop that vanished in the air or was spilled (on the earth)—when did it flee (escape) from the storehouse of Thy omnipotence? If it enter into non-existence or a hundred non-existences, it will make a foot of its head (will return in headlong haste) when Thou callest it. Hundreds of thousands of opposites are killing their opposites: Thy decree is drawing them forth again (from non-existence). There is caravan on caravan, O Lord, (speeding) continually from non-existence towards existence.",6
"In particular, every night all thoughts and understandings become naught, plunged in the deep Sea; Again at the time of dawn those Divine ones lift up their heads from the Sea, like fishes. In autumn the myriads of boughs and leaves go in rout into the sea of Death, (While) in the garden the crow clothed in black like a mourner makes lament over the (withered) greenery. Again from the Lord of the land comes the edict (saying) to Non-existence, “Give back what thou hast devoured!",6
"Give up, O black Death, what thou hast devoured of plants and healing herbs and leaves and grass!” O brother, collect thy wits for an instant (and think): from moment to moment (incessantly) there is autumn and spring within thee. Behold the garden of the heart, green and moist and fresh, full of rosebuds and cypresses and jasmines; Boughs hidden by the multitude of leaves, vast plain and high palace hidden by the multitude of flowers. These words, which are from Universal Reason, are the scent of those flowers and cypresses and hyacinths.",6
"Didst thou (ever) smell the scent of a rose where no rose was? Didst thou (ever) see the foaming of wine where no wine was? The scent is thy guide and conducts thee on thy way: it will bring thee to Eden and Kawthar. The scent is a remedy for the (sightless) eye; (it is) light-making: the eye of Jacob was opened by a scent. The foul scent darkens the eye, the scent of Joseph succours the eye. Thou who art not a Joseph, be a Jacob: be (familiar), like him, with weeping and sore distress.",6
"Hearken to this counsel from the Sage of Ghazna, that thou mayst feel freshness in thy old body: “Disdain needs a face like the rose; when thou hast not (such a face), do not indulge in ill-temper. Ugly is disdain in an uncomely face, grievous is eye-ache in an unseeing eye.” In the presence of Joseph do not give thyself airs and behave like a beauty: offer nothing but the supplication and sighs of Jacob. The meaning of dying (as conveyed) by the parrot was supplication (self-abasement): make thyself dead in supplication and poverty (of spirit),",6
"That the breath of Jesus may revive thee and make thee fair and blessed as itself. How should a rock be covered with verdure by the Spring? Become earth, that thou mayst grow flowers of many a hue. Years hast thou been a heart-jagging rock: once, for the sake of experiment, be earth! The story of the old harper who in the time of ‘Umar, may God be well-pleased with him, on a day when he was starvingplayed the harp for God's sake in the graveyard. Hast thou heard that in the time of ‘Umar there was a harper, a fine and glorious minstrel? The nightingale would be made beside herself by his voice: by his beautiful voice one rapture would be turned into a hundred.",6
"His breath was an ornament to assembly and congregation, and at his song the dead would arise. (He was) like Isráfíl (Seraphiel), whose voice will cunningly bring the souls of the dead into their bodies, Or he was (like) an accompanist to Isráfíl, for his music would make the elephant grow wings. One day Isráfíl will make a shrill sound and will give life to him that has been rotten for a hundred years. The prophets also have (spiritual) notes within, whence there comes life beyond price to them that seek (God).",7
"The sensual ear does not hear those notes, for the sensual ear is defiled by iniquities. The note of the peri is not heard by man, for he is unable to apprehend the mysteries of the peris, Although the note of the peri too belongs to this world. The note of the heart is higher than both breaths (notes), For peri and man (alike) are prisoners: both are (captive) in the prison of this ignorance. Recite O community of Jinn (and men) in the Súratu l’-Rahmán; recognise (the meaning of) if ye be able to pass forth.",7
"The inward notes of the saints say, at first, “O ye particles of lá (not=not-being), Take heed, lift up your heads from the lá of negation, put forth your heads from this fancy and vain imagining. O ye who all are rotten in (the world of) generation and corruption, your everlasting soul neither grew nor came to birth.” If I tell (even) a tittle of those (saintly) notes, the souls will lift up their heads from the tombs. Put thine ear close, for that (melody) is not far off, but ’tis not permitted to convey it to thee.",7
"Hark! for the saints are the Isráfíls of the (present) time: from them to the dead comes life and freshness. At their voice the dead souls in the body's grave start up in their winding-sheets. He (that is thus awakened) says, “This voice is separate from (all other) voices: to quicken (the dead) is the work of the voice of God. We (had) died and were entirely decayed: the call of God came: we all arose.” The call of God, (whether it be) veiled or unveiled, bestows that which He bestowed on Mary from His bosom.",7
"O ye who are rotten with death (in your hearts) underneath the skin, return from non-existence at the voice of the Friend! Absolutely, indeed, that voice is from the King (God), though it be from the larynx of God's servant. He (God) has said to him (the saint), “I am thy tongue and eye; I am thy senses and I am thy good pleasure and thy wrath. Go, for thou art (he of whom God saith), ‘By Me he hears and by Me he sees’: thou art the (Divine) consciousness (itself): what is the occasion (propriety) of (saying), ‘Thou art the possessor of the (Divine) consciousness’? Since thou hast become, through bewilderment, ‘He that belongs to God,’ I am thine, for ‘God shall belong to him.’",7
"Sometimes I say to thee, ‘’Tis thou,’ sometimes, ‘’Tis I’: whatever I say, I am the Sun illuminating (all). Wheresoever I shine forth from the lamp-niche of a breath (Divine word), there the difficulties of a (whole) world are resolved. The darkness which the (earthly) sun did not remove, through My breath that darkness becomes like bright morning.” To an Adam He in His own person showed the (Divine) Names; to the rest He was revealing the Names by means of Adam. Do thou receive His light either from Adam or from Himself: take the wine either from the jar or from the gourd (cup),",7
"For this gourd is very closely connected with the jar: the blessed gourd is not rejoiced (by the same causes) as thou art. Mustafá (Mohammed) said, “Happy he that has seen me and he that looks at him that saw my face.” When a lamp has derived (its) light from a candle, every one that sees it (the lamp) certainly sees the candle. If transmission (of the light) occurs in this way till a hundred lamps (are lighted), the seeing of the last (lamp) becomes a meeting with the original (light). Either take with (all) thy soul from the hindmost light—there is no difference—or from the candelabrum.",7
"Either behold the light (of God) from the lamp of the last (saints), or behold His light from the candle of those who have gone before. Explanation of the Tradition, “Verily, your Lord hath, during the days of your time, certain breathings: oh, address yourselves to (receive) them.” The Prophet said, “In these days the breathings of God prevail: Keep ear and mind (attentive) to these (spiritual) influences, catch up such-like breathings.” The (Divine) breathing came, beheld you, and departed: it gave life to whom it would, and departed. Another breathing has arrived. Be thou heedful, that thou mayst not miss this one too, O comrade.",7
"The soul of fire gained there from an extinguisher of (its) fire, the dead soul felt within itself a movement (of life). This is the freshness and movement of the Túbá-tree, this is not like the movements of animals. If it fall on earth and heaven, their galls will turn to water at once (they will be consumed with terror). Truly, from fear of this infinite breath (they were filled with dismay): recite (the words of the Qur’án) but they refused to bear it (the trust offered to them). Else, how should (the words) they shrank from it have been (in the Qur’án), unless from fear of it the heart of the mountain had become blood?",7
"Yesternight this (breath) presented itself (to me) in a different guise (but) some morsels (of food) came in and barred the way. For a morsel's sake a Luqmán has become (held in custody as) a pledge: ’tis the time for Luqmán: begone, O morsel! These pricks (of the flesh) for the sake of a morsel! Pluck ye forth the thorn from the sole of Luqmán. In his sole there is (really) no thorn or even the shadow of it, but because of concupiscence ye have not that discernment. Know that the thorn is that which thou, because thou art very greedy and very blind, hast deemed to be a date.",7
"Inasmuch as Luqmán's spirit is the rose-garden of God, why is the foot of his spirit wounded by a thorn? This thorn-eating existence is (like) a camel, and upon this camel one born of Mustafá (Mohammed) is mounted. O camel, on thy back is a bale of roses, from the perfume of which a hundred rosaries grew within thee. Thy inclination is towards thorn-bushes and sand: I wonder what roses thou wilt gather from worthless thorns. O thou who in this search hast roamed from one quarter to another, how long wilt thou say, “Where, where is this rose- garden?”",7
"Until thou extract this thorn in thy foot, thine eye is dark (blind): how wilt thou go about? Man, who is not contained in the world, becomes hidden in the point of a thorn! Mustafá (Mohammed) came (into the world) to make harmony: (he would say) “Speak to me, O Humayrá, speak!” O Humayrá, put the horse-shoe in the fire, that by means of thy horse-shoe this mountain may become (glowing with love, like) rubies. This “Humayrá” is a feminine word, and the Arabs call the (word for) “spirit” feminine;",7
"But there is no fear (harm) to the Spirit from being feminine: the Spirit has no association (nothing in common) with man and woman. It is higher than feminine and masculine: this is not that spirit which is composed of dryness and moisture. This is not that spirit which is increased by (eating) bread, or which is sometimes like this and sometimes like that. It is a doer of (what is) sweet, and (it is) sweet, and the essence of sweetness. Without (inward) sweetness there is no sweetness, O taker of bribes! When thou art (made) sweet by sugar, it may be that at some time that sugar will vanish from thee;",7
"(But) when thou becomest sugar from abundance of faithfulness, then how should sugar be parted from sugar? When the lover (of God) is fed from (within) himself with pure wine, there reason will remain lost and companionless. Partial (discursive) reason is a denier of Love, though it may give out that it is a confidant. It is clever and knowing, but it is not naught (devoid of self-existence): until the angel has become naught, he is an Ahriman (Devil). It (partial reason) is our friend in word and deed, (but) when you come to the case of inward feeling (ecstasy), it is naught (of no account). ",7
"It is naught because it did not (pass away) from existence and become nonexistent: since it did not become naught willingly, (it must become naught nevertheless, for) there is many a one (who became naught, i.e. died) unwillingly. The Spirit is perfection and its call is perfection: Mustafá (Mohammed) used to say, “Refresh us, O Bilál! O Bilál, lift up thy mellifluous voice (drawn) from that breath which I breathed into thy heart, From that breath by which Adam was dumbfounded and the wits of the people of Heaven were made witless.” Mustafá became beside himself at that beautiful voice: his prayer escaped him (was left unperformed) on the night of the ta‘rís.",7
"He did not raise his head from that blessed sleep until the (time of the) dawn prayer had advanced to (the time of) forenoon. On the night of the ta‘rís his holy spirit gained (the privilege of) kissing hands in the presence of the Bride. Love and the Spirit are, both of them, hidden and veiled: if I have called Him (God) the Bride, do not find fault. I would have been silent from (fear of) the Beloved's displeasure, if He had granted me a respite for one moment[#] But He keeps saying, “Say on! Come, ’tis no fault, ’tis but the requirement of the (Divine) destiny in the World Unseen.”",7
"The fault is (in him) who sees nothing but fault: how should the Pure Spirit of the Invisible see fault? Fault arises (only) in relation to the ignorant creature, not in relation to the Lord of favour (clemency). Infidelity, too, is wisdom in relation to the Creator, (but) when you impute it to us, infidelity is a noxious thing. And if there be one fault together with a hundred advantages (excellences), it resembles the wood (woody stalk) in the sugarcane. Both (sugar and stalk) alike are put into the scales, because they both are sweet like body and soul.",7
"Not idly, therefore, the great (mystics) said this: “The body of the holy ones (the saints) is essentially pure as (their) spirit.” Their speech and soul and form, all (this) is absolute spirit without (external) trace. The spirit that regards them with enmity is a mere body; like the plus in (the game called) nard, it is a mere name. That one (the body of the enemy of the saints) went into the earth (grave) and became earth entirely; this (holy body) went into the salt and became entirely pure— The (spiritual) salt through which Mohammed is more refined (than all others): he is more eloquent than that salt-seasoned (elegantly expressed) Hadíth.",7
"This salt is surviving in his heritage: those heirs of his are with thee. Seek them! He (the spiritual heir of Mohammed) is seated in front of thee, (but) where indeed is thy “front”? He is before thee, (but) where is the soul that thinks “before”? If hou fancy thou hast a “before” and “behind,” thou art tied to body and deprived of spirit. “Below” and “above,” “before” and “behind” are attributes of the body: the essence of the bright spirit is without direction (not limited by relations of place). Open thy (inward) vision with the pure light of the King. Beware of fancying, like one who is short-sighted,",7
"That thou art only this very (body living) in grief and joy. O (thou who art really) non-existence, where (are) “before” and “behind” (appertaining) to non-existence? ’Tis a day of rain: journey on till night—not (sped) by this (earthly) rain but by the rain of the Lord.The story of ‘Á’isha, may God be well-pleased with her, how she asked Mustafá (Mohammed), on whom be peace, saying, “It rained to-day: since thou wentest to the graveyard, how is it that thy clothes are not wet?” One day Mustafá went to the graveyard: he went with the bier of a man (who was one) of his friends. He made the earth so that it filled his grave: he quickened his seed under the earth. These trees are like the interred ones: they have lifted up their hands from the earth.",7
"They are making a hundred signs to the people and speaking plainly to him that hath ears (to hear). With green tongue and with long hand (fingers) they are telling secrets from the earth's conscience (inmost heart). (Sunk in earth) like ducks that have plunged their heads in water, they have become (gay as) peacocks, though (in winter) they were (dark and bare) as crows. If during the winter He imprisoned them (in ice and snow), God made those “crows” “peacocks” (in spring). Although He put them to death in winter, He revived them by means of spring and gave (them) leaves.",7
"The sceptics say, “This (creation), surely, is eternal: why should we fix it on a beneficent Lord?” God, in despite of them, caused (spiritual) gardens and plots of sweet flowers to grow in the hearts of His friends. Every rose that is sweet-scented within, that rose is telling of the secrets of the Universal. Their scent, to the confusion of the sceptics, is going round the world, rending the veil (of doubt and disbelief). The sceptics, (shrinking) from the scent of the rose like a beetle, or like a delicate (sensitive) brain at the noise of the drum,",7
"Feign themselves to be occupied and absorbed, and withdraw their eyes from the flash and the lightning. They withdraw their eyes, but no eye is there: the eye is that which sees a place of safety. When the Prophet returned from the graveyard, he went to the Siddíqa and confided (in her). As soon as the eye of the Siddíqa fell upon his countenance, she advanced and began to lay her hand on him, On his turban and his face and his hair, on his collar and chest and arm.",7
"Said the Prophet, “What art thou seeking so hastily?” She replied, “To-day rain fell from the clouds: I am searching thy garments in quest (of moisture), I do not feel them wet with the rain. Oh, how wonderful!” The Prophet said, “What wrap hast thou thrown over thy head?” Said she, “I made that ridá (plaid) of thine (serve as) a head- covering.” He said, “O pure-bosomed one, that is why God revealed to thy pure eye the rain of the Unseen. That rain is not from your clouds: there are other clouds and another sky.” Commentary on the verse of Hakím (Saná’í): “In the realm of the soul are skies lording over the sky of this world. In theWay of the spirit there are lowlands and highlands, there are lofty mountains and seas.”",7
"The Unseen World has other clouds and water (than ours), it has another sky and sun. That is not discerned save by the elect; the rest are in doubt as to a new creation. There is rain for the sake of nurture; there is (also) rain for the sake of decay. Marvellous is the benefit of the rain of springtime, (but) to the garden the autumnal rain is like a (consuming) fever. That vernal (rain) makes it tenderly nurtured (flourishing), while this autumnal (rain) makes it sickly and wan.",7
"Similarly know that cold and wind and sun are at variance (produce various effects); and find the clue. Even so in the Unseen World there are these different sorts, (consisting) in loss and gain and in profit and defraudment (damage). This breath of the Abdál (saints) is from that (spiritual) springtide: from it there grows a green garden in heart and soul. From their breaths there comes (is produced) in him who is fortunate the (same) effect (as that) of the spring rain on the tree. If there be in the place a dry tree, do not deem its defect to be due to the life quickening wind.",7
"The wind did its own work and blew on: he that had a soul chose it in preference to his soul. On the meaning of the Tradition, “Take advantage of the coolness of the spring season, etc.” The Prophet said, “Give heed, my friends! Do not cover your bodies from the cold of spring, For it does to your spirits the same thing that spring does to the trees; But flee from the cold of autumn, for it does what autumn did to the garden and the vines.” The traditionists have referred this (saying) to the outward (sense), and have been content with that same (outward) form.",7
"That class (of people) were ignorant of the spirit: they saw the mountain, they did not see the mine in the mountain. In the sight of God that “autumn” is the flesh (nafs) and (its) desires: the reason and the spirit are the essence of spring and are everlasting life. Thou hast a partial reason hidden (within thee): (now) in this world seek one whose reason is perfect. Through his whole thy part is made whole (and perfect): Universal Reason is like a shackle on the neck of the flesh. Therefore, according to the (right) interpretation, it (the meaning) is this, that the holy breaths are like spring and the life of leaf and vine.",7
"The sayings of the saints, whether soft or rough, do not thou cover thy body (against them), for they are the support of thy religion. Whether he (the saint) speak hot or cold, receive (his words) with joy: thereby thou wilt escape from the hot and cold (of Nature) and from Hell-fire. His “hot” and “cold” is life's new season of spring, the source of sincerity and faith and service. Inasmuch as the garden of the spirits is living through him, and the sea of (his) heart is filled with these pearls, Thousands of griefs lie (heavy) on a wise man's heart, if from the garden of his heart (even) a toothpick fail (be missing). How the Siddíqa (‘Á’isha), may God be well-pleased with her, asked Mustafá (Mohammed), God bless him and give him peace, saying, “What was the inner meaning of to-day's rain?”",7
"The Siddíqa said, “O (thou who art the) cream of existence, what was the (true) reason of to-day's rain? Was it (one) of the rains of mercy, or (was it) for the sake of menace and the justice of (Divine) Majesty? Was it from the favour of the vernal attributes, or from a baneful autumnal attribute?” He said, “This (rain) was for the purpose of allaying the grief that is upon the race of Adam in calamity. If man were to remain in that fire (of grief), much ruin and loss would befall.",7
"This world would at once become desolate: (all) selfish desires would go forth from men.” Forgetfulness (of God), O beloved, is the pillar (prop) of this world: (spiritual) intelligence is a bane to this world. Intelligence belongs to that (other) world, and when it prevails, this world is overthrown. Intelligence is the sun and cupidity the ice; intelligence is the water and this world the dirt. A little trickle (of intelligence) is coming from yonder world, that cupidity and envy may not roar (too loudly) in this world.",7
"If the trickle from the Unseen should become greater, in this world neither virtue nor vice will be left. This (topic) has no bound. Go to the starting-point, go back to the tale of the minstrel. The remainder of the story of the old harper and the explanation of its issue (moral) That minstrel by whom the world was filled with rapture, from whose voice wondrous phantasies grew (arose in the minds of those who heard him), At whose song the bird of the soul would take wing, and at whose note the mind of the spirit would be distraught— When time passed and he grew old, from weakness the falcon, his soul, became a catcher of gnats.",7
"His back became bent like the back of a wine-jar, the brows over his eyes like a crupper-strap. His charming soul-refreshing voice became ugly and worth nothing to any one. The tone that had (once) been the envy of Zuhra (Venus) was now like the bray of an old donkey. Truly, what fair thing is there that did not become foul, or what roof that did not become a carpet?— Except the voices of holy men in their breasts, from the repercussion of whose breath is the blast of the trumpet (of Resurrection).",7
"(Theirs is) the heart by which (all) hearts are made drunken, (theirs is) the nonexistence whereby these existences of ours are made existent. He (the saint) is the amber (magnet) of (all) thought and of every voice; he is the (inward) delight of revelation and inspiration and (Divine) mystery. When the minstrel grew older and feeble, through not earning (anything) he became indebted for a single loaf of bread. He said, “Thou hast given me long life and respite: O God, Thou hast bestowed (many) favours on a vile wretch. For seventy years I have been committing sin, (yet) not for one day hast Thou withheld Thy bounty from me.",7
"I (can) earn nothing: to-day I am Thy guest, I will play the harp for Thee, I am Thine.” He took up his harp and went in search of God to the graveyard of Medina, crying “Alas!” He said, “I crave of God the price of silk (for harpstrings), for He in His kindness accepts adulterated coin.” He played the harp a long while and (then), weeping, laid his head down: he made the harp his pillow and dropped on a tomb. Sleep overtook him: the bird, his soul, escaped from captivity, it let harp and harper go and darted away.",7
"It became freed from the body and the pain of this world in the simple (purely spiritual) world and the vast region of the soul. There his soul was singing what had befallen (it), saying, “If they would but let me stay here, Happy would be my soul in this garden and springtide, drunken with this (far stretching) plain and mystic anemone-field. Without head or foot I would be journeying, without lip or tooth I would be eating sugar. With a memory and thought free from brain-sickness, I would frolic with the dwellers in Heaven.",7
"With eye shut I would be seeing a (whole) world, without a hand I would be gathering roses and basil.” The water-bird (his soul) was plunged in a sea of honey— the fountain of Job, to drink and wash in, Whereby Job, from his feet to the crown of his head, was purged of afflictions (and made pure) like the light of the sunrise. If the Mathnawí were as the sky in magnitude, not half the portion of this (mystery) would find room in it, For the exceeding broad earth and sky (of the material world) caused my heart, from (their) narrowness (in comparison with the spiritual universe), to be rent in pieces;",7
"And this world that was revealed to me in this dream (of the minstrel) has spread wide my wings and pinions because of (its vast) expansion. If this world and the way to it were manifest, no one would remain there (in the material world) for a single moment. The (Divine) command was coming (to the minstrel)—“Nay, be not covetous: inasmuch as the thorn is out of thy foot, depart”— (Whilst) his soul was lingering there in the spacious demesne of His (God's) mercy and beneficence. How the heavenly voice spoke to ‘Umar, may God be well-pleased with him, while he was asleep, saying, “Give a certainsum of gold from the public treasury to the man who is sleeping in the graveyard.” Then God sent such a drowsiness upon ‘Umar that he was unable to keep himself from slumber.",7
"He fell into amazement saying, “This is (a thing) unknown. This has fallen from the Unseen, ’tis not without purpose.” He laid his head down, and slumber overtook him. He dreamed that a voice came to him from God: his spirit heard That voice which is the origin of every cry and sound: that indeed is the (only) voice, and the rest are echoes. Turcoman and Kurd and Persian-speaking man and Arab have understood that voice without (help of) ear or lip. Ay, (but) what of Turcomans, Persians, and Ethiopians? (Even) wood and stone have understood that voice.",7
"Every moment there is coming from Him (the call), “Am not I (your Lord)?” and substance and accidents are becoming existent. If (the answer) “Yea” is not coming from them, yet their coming from non-existence (into existence) is (equivalent to) “Yea.” Listen to a goodly tale in explanation of what I have said concerning the friendliness (awareness) of stone and wood. How the moaning pillar complained when they made a pulpit for the Prophet, on whom be peace—for the multitude had become great, and said, “We do not see thy blessed face when thou art exhorting us”—and how the Prophet and hisCompanions heard that complaint, and how Mustafá conversed with the pillar in clear language. The moaning pillar was complaining of (its) separation from the Prophet, just as rational beings (might do). The Prophet said, “O pillar, what dost thou want?” It said, “My soul is turned to blood because of parting from thee.",7
"I was thy support: (now) thou hast run away from me: thou hast devised a place to lean against upon the pulpit.” “Dost thou desire,” said he, “to be made a date-palm, (so that) the people of the East and the West shall gather fruit from thee? Or that He (God) should make thee a cypress in yonder world, so that thou wilt remain everlastingly fresh and flourishing?” It replied, “I desire that whereof the life is enduring for ever.” Hearken, O heedless one! Be not thou less than a piece of wood! He (the Prophet) buried that pillar in the earth, that it may be raised from the dead, like mankind, on the day of Resurrection,",7
"That (hence) thou mayst know that every one whom God has called (to Himself) remains disengaged from all the work of this world. Whosoever hath his work and business from God, gains admission there and goes forth from (abandons worldly) work. He that hath no gift (portion) of spiritual mysteries, how should he believe in the complaining of inanimate things? He says “Yes,” not from his heart (but) for agreement's sake, lest people should say that he is a hypocrite (in his religion). Unless there were knowers of the (Divine) command “Be!”, this doctrine (that inanimate things are capable of speech) would have been rejected in the world.",7
"Myriads of conformists and legalists are cast into the abyss (of destruction) by a single taint (of doubt), For their conformity and their drawing evidence from logical proofs and all their wings and wing-feathers (every means which they employ in order to arrive at the truth) depend on opinion. The vile Devil raises a doubt (in their minds): all these blind ones fall in headlong. The leg of the syllogisers is of wood: a wooden leg is very infirm, Unlike the Qutb (supreme saint) of the age, the possessor of (spiritual) vision, by whose steadfastness the mountain is made giddy-headed (amazed).",7
"The blind man's leg is a staff, a staff, so that he may not fall headlong on the pebbles. The cavalier that became (the cause of) victory for the army, who is he for (the army of) the religious? One possessed of (spiritual) sight. If, with (the aid of) a staff, the blind have seen their way, (yet only) under the protection of (other) people are they clear- sighted. Were there no men of vision and (spiritual) kings, all the blind in the world would be dead. From the blind comes neither sowing nor reaping nor cultivation nor tradings and profit.",7
"If He (God) did not bestow mercy and grace upon you, the wood of your logical deduction would break. What is this staff? Inferences and (logical) demonstration. Who gave them (the blind) that staff? The all-seeing and almighty One. Since the staff has become a weapon of quarrel and attack, break that staff to pieces, O blind man! He gave you the staff that ye might approach (Him): with that staff ye struck even at Him in your anger. O company of the blind, what are ye doing? Bring the seer between (you and God)!",7
"Lay hold of His skirt who gave thee the staff: consider what (dreadful) things Adam suffered from disobedience. Consider the miracles of Moses and Ahmad (Mohammed), how the staff became a serpent and the pillar was endowed with knowledge. From the staff (came) a serpent and from the pillar a moaning: they (the staff and the pillar) are beating (the drums of honour) five times daily for the sake of the Religion. Unless this savour (perception of spiritual truths) were non-intellectual, how should all these miracles have been necessary? Whatever is intelligible, the intellect is swallowing (receiving) it without the evidence of miracles and without contention.",7
"This virgin (untrodden) Way deem unintelligible, deem (it) accepted in the heart of every fortunate (elect) one. As in fear of Adam devil and wild beast fled to the islands, from envy, So in fear of the miracles of the prophets have the sceptics slunk away under the grass, That they may live in hypocrisy with the reputation of being Moslems, and that you may not know who they are. Like counterfeiters, they smear the base coin with silver and (inscribe on it) the name of the King.",7
"The outward form of their words is profession of the Divine Unity and the religion (of Islam): the inward meaning thereof is like darnel (?) seed in bread. The philosopher has not the stomach (courage) to breathe a word: if he utter a word, the true Religion will confound him. His hand and foot are inanimate, and whatever his spirit says (commands), those two are under its control. Albeit they (the sceptics) propound (reasons for) suspicion with their tongues, their hands and feet give testimony (against them). How the Prophet, on whom be peace, manifested a miracle by the speaking of the gravel in the hand of Abú Jahl—God'scurse on him!—and by the gravel's bearing witness to the truth of Mohammed, on whom be God's blessing and peace. There were some pebbles in the hand of Bú Jahl: “O Ahmad,” said he, “tell quickly what this is.",7
"If thou art the Messenger (of God), what is hidden in my fist? (Speak), since thou hast knowledge of the mysteries of Heaven.” He said, “How dost thou wish (me to do)? Shall I say what those (hidden) things are, or shall they declare that I am truthful and right?” Bú Jahl said, “This second (thing) is more extraordinary.” “Yes,” said the Prophet, “(but) God hath greater power than that.” Without delay, from the middle of his (closed) fist every pebble began to pronounce the (Moslem's) profession of faith. Each said, “There is no god” and (each) said, “except Allah”; (each) threaded the pearl of “Ahmad is the Messenger of Allah.”",7
"When Bú Jahl heard this from the pebbles, in his anger he dashed those pebbles on the ground. The rest of the story of the minstrel, and how the Commander of the Faithful, ‘Umar, may God be well-pleased with him,conveyed to him the message spoken by the heavenly voice. Turn back and hear the plight of the minstrel, for the minstrel had (now) become desperate from waiting (so long). The voice (of God) came to ‘Umar, saying, “O ‘Umar, redeem Our servant from want. We have a servant, a favourite and highly esteemed one: take the trouble to go on foot to the graveyard. O ‘Umar, spring up and put in thy hand full seven hundred dínárs from the public treasury.",7
"Carry them to him (and say), ‘O thou who art Our choice, accept this sum now and excuse (Us for offering such a small gift). Spend this amount on the price (purchase) of silk: when it is spent, come here (again).’” Then ‘Umar in awe of that voice sprang up that he might gird his loins for this service. ‘Umar set his face towards the graveyard with the purse under his arm, running in search (of God's favourite). Long did he run round about the graveyard: no one was there but that poor old man.",7
"He said, “This is not he,” and ran once more. He became tired out and saw none but the old man. He said, “God said, ‘We have a servant: he is a pure and worthy and blessed one.’ How should an old harper be the chosen of God? O Hidden Mystery, how excellent, how excellent art Thou!” Once again he wandered about the graveyard, like the hunting lion about the desert. When it became certain to him that none was there except the old man, he said, “Many an illumined heart is (to be found) in darkness.”",7
"He came and sat down there (beside him) with a hundred marks of respect. ‘Umar happened to sneeze, and the old man sprang to his feet. He saw ‘Umar and stood fixed in amazement: he resolved to go and began to tremble (with fear). He said within himself, “O God, help, I beseech thee! The Inspector has fallen upon a poor old harper.” When ‘Umar looked on the old man's countenance, he saw him ashamed and pale. Then ‘Umar said to him, “Fear not, do not flee from me, for I have brought thee glad tidings from God.",7
"How often has God praised thy disposition, so that He has made ‘Umar in love with thy face! Sit down beside me and do not make separation (between us), that I may say into thine ear the secret (message) from (the Divine) favour. God sends thee greeting and asks thee how thou farest in thy distress and boundless sorrows. Lo, here are some pieces of gold to pay for silk. Spend them and come back to this place.” The old man heard this, trembling all over and biting his hand and tearing his garment,",7
"Crying, “O God who hast no like!” inasmuch as the poor old man was melted with shame. After he had wept long and his grief had gone beyond (all) bounds, he dashed his harp on the earth and broke it to bits. He said, “O thou (harp) that hast been to me a curtain (debarring me) from God, O thou (that hast been) to me a brigand (cutting me off) from the King's highway, O thou that hast drunk my blood for seventy years, O thou because of whom my face is black (disgraced) before (the Divine) perfection! Have mercy, O bounteous God who keepest faith, on a life passed in iniquity!",7
"God gave (me) a life, the value of every single day whereof none knoweth except Him. I have spent my life, breath by breath: I have breathed it all away in treble and bass. Ah me, that in minding the (musical) mode and rhythm of ‘Iráq the bitter moment of parting (from this world) went out of my mind (was forgotten). Alas that from the liquid freshness of the minor zírafgand the seed sown in my heart dried up, and my heart died. Alas that from (my preoccupation with) the sound of these four-and-twenty (melodies) the caravan passed and the day grew late.”",7
"O God, help (me) against this (self of mine) that is seeking help (from Thee): I seek justice (redress) from no one (else, but only) from this justice-seeking (self). I shall not get justice for myself from any one except, surely, from Him who is nearer to me than I; For this “I-hood” comes to me from Him moment by moment: therefore when this has failed me, I see (only) Him, As (when you are with) one who is counting out gold to you, you keep your gaze (directed) towards him, not towards yourself. How ‘Umar, may God be well-pleased with him, bade him (the harper) turn his gaze from the stage of weeping, which is(self-) existence, to the stage of absorption (in God), which is non-existence (of self). Then ‘Umar said to him, “This wailing of thine is also (one of) the marks of thy sobriety (self-consciousness).",7
"The way of him that has passed away (from self-consciousness) is another way, because sobriety is another sin. Sobriety exists (arises) from recollection of what is past: past and future are to thee a curtain (separating thee) from God. Cast fire on them both: how long, because of these twain, wilt thou be full of knots (joints) like a reed? Whilst the reed is knotted, it is not a sharer of secrets: it is not the companion of the (flute-player's) lip and voice. When thou art (engaged) in going about (seeking God) thou art indeed wrapped in (thy) going about: when thou hast come home, thou art still with thyself (self-conscious).",7
"O thou whose knowledge is without knowledge of the Giver of knowledge, thy repentance is worse than thy sin. O thou that seekest to repent of a state that is past, say, when wilt thou repent of this repentance? At one time thou turnest to the (low) sound of the treble, at another thou dost kiss (art in love with) weeping and wailing.” When Fárúq (‘Umar) became a reflector of mysteries, the old man's heart was awakened from within. He became without weeping or laughter, like the soul: his (animal) soul departed and the other soul came to life.",7
"In that hour such a bewilderment arose within him that he went forth from earth and heaven— A seeking and searching beyond (all) seeking and search: I know not (how to describe it); (if) you know, tell! Words and feelings beyond (all) feelings and words—he had become drowned in the beauty of the Lord of majesty, Drowned, not in such wise that there should be for him any deliverance, or that any one should know him except the (Divine) Ocean. Partial reason would not be telling of (the mysteries of) the Universal (Reason), if there were not demand after demand (perpetual Divine impulses necessitating the manifestation of these mysteries).",7
"Since demand after demand is arriving, the waves of that Sea (Universal Reason) reach this place (the world of partial reason). Now that the story of the old man's (spiritual) experiences has come to this point, the old man and his experiences have withdrawn behind the veil. The old man has shaken his skirt free from talk and speech: half of the tale has remained in our mouth (has not been told). It behoves (us), for the sake of procuring (such) delight and enjoyment, to gamble away (sacrifice) hundreds of thousands of souls (lives). In chase of the spiritual forest be (as) a falcon, be one who gambles his soul (life) away, like the sun of this world.",7
"The lofty sun is life-diffusing: every moment it becomes empty and is filled. O Sun of Reality, diffuse spiritual life, show forth newness to this old world! Soul and spirit are coming from the Unseen into human existence, like running water. Commentary on the prayer of the two angels who daily make proclamation in every market, saying, “O God, bestow onevery prodigal some boon in exchange! O God, bestow on every niggard some bane (in return)”; and an explanation that the prodigal is he that strives earnestly in the Way of God, not he that squanders his wealth in the way of sensuality. The Prophet said, “For admonishment's sake two angels are always making goodly proclamation, Saying, ‘O God, keep the prodigals fully satisfied, give hundred-thousandfold recompense for every dirhem that they spend.",7
"O God, do not give the niggards in this world anything but loss upon loss!’” Oh, (there is) many an act of niggardliness that is better than prodigality: do not bestow what belongs to God except by the command of God, That thou mayst gain infinite treasure in return, and that thou mayst not be numbered among the infidels Who were offering camels in sacrifice in order that their swords might prevail against Mustafá. Endeavour to find out the command of God from one who is united (with God): not every heart understands the command of God,",7
"As (for example) the slave, the enemy (of God), who did justice (in his own opinion, and) bestowed what belonged to the King upon those who rebelled against Him— In the Qur’án there is warning to the heedless that all their spendings are a (cause of) bitter grief to them— What increase does the equity and justice of this enemy produce in the sight of the King? Banishment and a black countenance (disgrace). The chiefs of Mecca (when) at war with the Prophet offered sacrifice in hope of (Divine) favour. On this account the true believer is saying in his prayer, from fear, “Lead (us) in the right path!”",7
"It beseems the generous man thus to give money, (but) verily the generosity of the lover is the surrender of his soul (life). If you give bread for God's sake, you will be given bread (in return); if you give your life for God's sake, you will be given life (in return). If the leaves of this plane-tree drop off, the Creator will bestow on it the provision of leaflessness (spiritual poverty). If because of your liberality no wealth remains in your hand, how should the bounty of God let you be down-trodden? When any one sows, his barn becomes empty (of seed), but there is goodliness in his cornfield;",7
"And, if he leaves it (the seed) in the barn and saves it up, weevils and mice and calamities (of time and decay) devour it. This world is negation (of reality): seek (reality) in affirmation (of God). Your form (body) is void (of reality): seek in your essence. Bring the briny bitter (animal) soul to the sword: buy the (heavenly) soul that is like a great sweet river. And if you cannot become (one of the frequenters) of this threshold (sublime court), at least hear from me the following tale. The story of the Caliph who in his time surpassed Hátim of Tayyi' in generosity and had no rival. In former days there was a Caliph who made Hátim the slave of his liberality.",7
"He had raised high the banner of munificence and largesse, he had removed poverty and want from the world. He was a sea of pearls, pure bounty: his largesse reached from Qáf to Qáf. In this world of dust he was the cloud and the rain: he was the centre wherein the bounty of the Giver of all displayed itself. His gifts caused sea and mine to quake (tremble with shame): caravan on caravan (were hastening) towards his liberality. His gate and portal was the point to which Need turned: the fame of his munificence had gone (far and wide) into the world.",7
"Persians and Greeks, Turcomans and Arabs, were lost in amazement at his liberality and generosity. He was the Water of Life and the Ocean of Bounty: by him both Arabs and foreigners were revived. Story of the poor Arab of the desert and his wife's altercation with him because of (their) penury and poverty. One night a Bedouin woman said to her husband—and she carried (her) talk beyond bounds— “We are suffering all this poverty and hardship: all the world are (living) in happiness, we (alone) are unhappy. We have no bread, our (only) condiment is anguish and envy: we have no jug, our (only) water is the tears (that flow) from our eyes.",7
"Our garment by day is the burning sunshine; at night our bed and coverlet is (made) of the moonbeams. We fancy the disk of the moon is a disk (round cake) of bread and lift up our hands towards the sky. The (poorest of the) poor feel shame at our poverty: day is turned to night (darkened) by our anxiety about our daily portion (of food). Kinsfolk and strangers have come to flee from us in like fashion as Sámirí from men. If I beg a handful of lentils from some one, he says to me, ‘Be silent, O death and plague!’",8
"The Arabs take pride in fighting and giving: thou amongst the Arabs art like a fault in writing.” What fighting (can we do)? We are killed without fighting, we are made giddy (utterly distracted) by the sword of want. What gifts (can we make)? We are continually in beggary, we are slitting the vein of (slaughtering) the gnat in the air. If any guest arrive, if I am I (as sure as I am living) I will go for his tattered cloak when he falls asleep at night. How disciples (novices in Súfism) are beguiled in their need by false impostors and imagine them to be Shaykhs andvenerable personages and (saints) united (with God), and do not know the difference between fact (naqd) and fiction (naql)and between what is tied on (artificially) and what has grown up (naturally). For this reason the wise have said with knowledge, ‘One must become the guest of those who confer benefits.’",8
"Thou art the disciple and guest of one who, from his vileness, robs thee of all thou hast. He is not strong: how should he make thee strong? He does not give light, (nay) he makes thee dark. Since he had no light (in himself), how in association (with him) should others obtain light from him? (He is) like the half-blind healer of eyes: what should he put in (people's) eyes except wool? Such is our state in poverty and affliction: may no guest be beguiled by us!",8
"If thou hast never seen a ten years' famine in (visible) forms, open thine eyes and look at us. Our outward appearance is like the inward reality of the impostor: darkness in his heart, his tongue flashy (plausible). He has no scent or trace of God, (but) his pretension is greater than (that of) Seth and the Father of mankind (Adam). The Devil (is so ashamed of him that he) has not shown to him even his portrait, (yet) he (the impostor) is saying, ‘We are of the Abdál and are more (we are superior even to them).’ He has stolen many an expression used by dervishes, in order that he himself may be thought to be a (holy) personage.",8
"In his talk he cavils at Báyazíd, (although) Yazíd would be ashamed of his existence. (He is) without (any) portion of the bread and viands of Heaven: God did not throw a single bone to him. He has proclaimed, ‘I have laid out the dishes, I am the Vicar of God, I am the son of the (spiritual) Khalífa: Welcome (to the feast), O simple-hearted ones, tormented (with hunger), that from my bounteous table ye may eat your fill’— of nothing. Some persons, (relying) on the promise of ‘To-morrow,’ have wandered for years around that door, (but) ‘To-morrow’ never comes.",8
"It needs a long time for the inmost conscience of a man to become evident, more and less (both in great and small matters), (So that we may know whether) beneath the wall of his body there is treasure, or whether there is the house of snake and ant and dragon. When it became clear that he was naught (worthless), (by that time) the life of the seeker (disciple) had passed: what use (was) the knowledge (to him)? Explaining how it may happen, (though) rarely, that a disciple sincerely puts his faith in a false impostor (and believes)that he is a (holy) personage, and by means of this faith attains unto a (spiritual) degree which his Shaykh has never (even) dreamed of, and (then) fire and water do him no hurt, though they hurt his Shaykh; but this occurs very seldom. But exceptionally comes (the case of) a disciple to whom, because of his (spiritual) illumination, that falsehood (of the impostor) is beneficial. He, by his goodly purpose, attains unto a (high) degree, although he fancied (the impostor to be) soul, and that (soul) proved to be (only) body.",8
"(It is) like trying to find the qibla in the heart (depth) of night: the qibla is not (found), but his (the seeker's) prayer is valid. The impostor has a dearth of soul within, but we have a dearth of bread without. Why should we conceal (our poverty) like the impostor and suffer agony for the sake of false reputation?” How the Bedouin bade his wife be patient and declared to her the excellence of patience and poverty. Her husband said to her, “How long wilt thou seek income and seed-produce? What indeed is left of (our) life? Most (of it) is past. The sensible man does not look at increase or deficiency, because both (these) will pass by like a torrent.",8
"Whether it (life) be pure (clear and untroubled) or whether it be a turbid flood, do not speak of it, since it is not enduring for a moment. In this world thousands of animals are living happily, without up and down (anxiety). The dove on the tree is uttering thanks to God, though her food for the night is not (yet) ready. The nightingale is singing glory to God (and saying), ‘I rely on Thee for my daily bread, O Thou who answerest (prayer).’ The falcon has made the king's hand his joy (the place in which he takes delight), and has given up hope of (has become indifferent to) all carrion.",8
"Similarly you may take (every animal) from the gnat to the elephant: they all have become God's family (dependent on Him for their nourishment), and what an excellent nourisher is God! All these griefs that are within our breasts arise from the vapour and dust of our existence and wind (vain desire). These uprooting griefs are as a scythe to us: (to think that) this is such and such or that that is such and such is a temptation (of the Devil) to us. Know that every pain is a piece of Death: expel (that) part of Death from thee, if there be a means (of doing so). When thou canst not flee from the part of Death, know that the whole of it will be poured upon thy head.",8
"If the part of Death has become sweet to thee, know that God will make the whole sweet. Pains are coming from Death as (his) messengers: do not avert thy face from his messenger, O foolish one! Whoever lives sweetly (pleasantly) dies bitterly (painfully): whoever serves his body does not save his soul. Sheep are driven from the plains (to the town): the fatter they are, the quicker they are killed. The night is past and dawn is come. O my soul, how long wilt thou take up (again) the tale of gold from the beginning?",8
"Thou wert young (once), and (then) thou wert more contented: (now) thou hast become a seeker of gold, (but) at first thou wert gold indeed (precious and perfect). Thou wert a fruitful vine: how hast thou become unsaleable (worthless)? How hast thou become rotten when thy fruit is ripening? Thy fruit ought to become sweeter and not move farther backwards like rope-makers. Thou art my wife: the wife must be of the same quality (as the husband) in order that things may go rightly. The married pair must match one another: look at a pair of shoes or boots.",8
"If one of the shoes is too tight for the foot, the pair of them is of no use to thee. Hast thou ever seen one leaf of a (folding) door small and the other large, or a wolf mated with the lion of the jungle? A pair of sacks on a camel do not balance properly when one is small and the other of full size. I march with stout heart towards contentment: why art thou betaking thyself to revilement?” In this fashion the contented man, moved by sincerity and ardour, was talking to his wife till daybreak. How the wife counselled her husband, saying, “Don't talk any more about thy merit and (spiritual) rank—‘why say ye that which ye do not?’—for although these words are true, yet thou hast not attained to the degree of trust in God, and to speak thus above thy station and devotional practice is harmful and ‘exceedingly hateful in the sight of God.’”",8
"The wife cried out at him, saying, “O thou who makest reputation thy religion, I will not swallow thy spells (deceiving speeches) any more. Don't talk nonsense in thy presumption and pretension: begone, don't speak from pride and arrogance. How long (wilt thou utter) pompous and artificial phrases? Look at thine own acts and feelings and be ashamed! Pride is ugly, and in beggars (all the) more ugly: (it is like) wet clothes after a cold snowy day. How long (this) pretension and palaver and bluster, O thou whose house is (frail) as the house of the spider?",8
"When hast thou illumined thy soul by contentment? Of contentment thou hast learned (only) the name. The Prophet said, ‘What is contentment? A treasure.’ Thou canst not distinguish the gain from the pain. This contentment is the soul's treasure: do not thou boast (of possessing it), O (thou who art) grief and pain to my soul. Don't call me thy mate, don't flap so much. I am the mate of justice, I am not the mate of fraud. How art thou walking (consorting) with amír and bey, when thou art slitting the veins of (killing for food) the locust in the air?",8
"Thou art contending with dogs for the sake of a bone, thou art wailing like an empty-bellied reed-pipe. Don't look at me dully (coldly) with contempt, lest I tell (others) what is in thy veins (disclose thy hidden faults).Thou hast deemed thy understanding superior to mine, (but) how hast thou (truly) seen me, who am deficient in understanding? Don't spring upon me like a reckless wolf! Oh, better be without understanding (mad) than (suffer) the disgrace of (having) thy understanding. Since thy understanding is a shackle for mankind, it is not understanding: it is a snake and scorpion.",8
"May God be the enemy of thy iniquity and deceit! May the deceitfulness of thy understanding fall short of (fail to injure) us! Thou art both the snake and the charmer—oh, wonderful! Thou art (both) the snakecatcher and the snake, O thou disgrace to the Arabs! If the crow knew its ugliness, from grief and sorrow it would melt like snow. The charmer chants (a spell) as an enemy (does); he is (casting) a spell upon the snake and the snake is (casting) a spell upon him. If his trap were not (devised by him as) a spell for the snake (a means of catching it), how would he become a prey to the snake's spell?",8
"The charmer, from greed and (desire of) getting and making (money), is not conscious of the snake's spell at the time. The snake says, ‘O charmer, beware, beware! Thou hast beheld thine own spell (and its effect upon me): now behold mine! Thou beguilest me with the Name of God in order that thou mayst expose me to shame and confusion. The Name of God enthralled me, not thy contrivance: thou madest the Name of God a trap: woe to thee! The Name of God will take vengeance from thee on my behalf: I commit my soul and body to the Name of God.",8
"Either it will sever the vein of thy life by my stroke, or it will bring thee into a prison as (it has brought) me.’” Rough speeches of this sort, (whole) volumes, the woman recited to her youthful husband. How the man counselled his wife, saying, “Do not look with contempt on the poor, but regard the work of God as perfect, and do not let thy vain thought and opinion of thine own penury cause thee to sneer at poverty and revile the poor.” “O woman,” said he, “art thou a woman or the father of sorrow? Poverty is (my) pride, and do not thou beat me on the head (lash me with thy reproaches). Wealth and gold are as a cap to the head: ’tis the bald man that makes a shelter of his cap, (But) he that has curly and beautiful locks is happier when his cap is gone.",8
"The man of God (the saint) resembles the eye: therefore (his) sight is better bare (unveiled) than covered. When a slave-dealer offers (slaves) for sale, he removes from the (sound) slave the garment that hides defects. But if there be any defect, how should he strip (the slave)? Nay, he tricks him (the purchaser) by means of the garment. ‘This one,’ says he, ‘is ashamed of good and evil: stripping him would cause him to run away from thee.’ The (rich) merchant is plunged in vice up to the ears, (but) the merchant has money, and his money covers his vice,",8
"For because of cupidity none that is covetous sees his vice: feelings of cupidity are a bond uniting (men's) hearts; And if a beggar speak a word like the (pure) gold of the mine, his wares will not find the way to the shop. The affair of (spiritual) poverty is beyond thy apprehension: do not look on poverty with contempt, Because dervishes are beyond property and wealth: they possess an abundant portion from the Almighty.The High God is just, and how should the just behave tyrannously to the dispirited (poor and weak)?",8
"(How should they) give fortune and goods to that one, while they put this one on the fire? The fire burns him because he hath this (evil) thought about the Lord who created both worlds. Is (the saying) ‘Poverty is my pride’ vain and false? No; ’tis thousands of hidden glories and disdains. Thou in anger hast poured nicknames on me: thou hast called me a catcher (deceiver) of friends and a catcher of snakes. If I catch the snake, I extract its fangs in order that I may save it from having its head crushed.",8
"Because those fangs are an enemy to its life, I am making the enemy a friend by means of this skill. Never do I chant my spell from (motives of) cupidity: I have turned this cupidity upside down (I have entirely vanquished it). God forbid! I desire nothing from created beings: through contentment there is a (whole) world within my heart. Thou, (sitting) on the top of the pear-tree, seest (things) like that: come down from it, that the (evil) thought may not continue. When thou turnest round and round and becomest giddy, thou seest the house turning round, and ’tis thou (thyself) art that (revolving object). Explaining how every one's movement (action) proceeds from the place where he is, (so that) he sees every one (else) fromthe circle of his own self-existence: a blue glass shows the sun as blue, a red glass as red, (but) when the glass escapes from(the sphere of) colour, it becomes white, (and then) it is more truthful than all other glasses and is the Imám (exemplar to them all).",8
"Abú Jahl saw Ahmad (Mohammed) and said, ‘’Tis an ugly figure that has sprung from the sons of Háshim!’ Ahmad said to him, ‘Thou art right, thou hast spoken truth, although thou art impertinent.’ The Siddíq (Abú Bakr) saw him and said, ‘O Sun, thou art neither of East nor of West: shine beauteously!’ Ahmad said, ‘Thou hast spoken the truth, O dear friend, O thou that hast escaped from this world of nothingness.’ They that were present said, ‘O king, why didst thou call both of them truth-tellers when they contradicted each other?’",8
"He replied, ‘I am a mirror polished by the (Divine) hand: Turcoman and Indian behold in me that which exists (in themselves).’ O wife, if thou deemest me very covetous, rise above this womanish care (for worldly things). This (state of mine) resembles cupidity and (in reality) it is a (Divine) mercy: where that (spiritual) blessing is, where is cupidity? Make trial of poverty for a day or two, that thou mayst see (find) in poverty double riches. Have patience with poverty and abandon this disgust, because in poverty there is the light of the Lord of glory.",8
"Do not look sour, and (thou wilt) see thousands of souls plunged, through contentment, in an ocean of honey. Behold hundreds of thousands of bitterly suffering souls steeped in rose-syrup, like the rose. Oh, alas, would that thou hadst comprehension, so that the unfolded tale of my heart might be shown forth to thee from my soul. This discourse is milk in the teat of the soul: it will not flow well without some one to suck (the teat). When the hearer has become thirsty and craving, the preacher, (even) if he be (as good as) dead, becomes eloquent.",8
"When the hearer is fresh and without fatigue (not bored), the dumb and mute will find a hundred tongues to speak withal.When a stranger comes in at my door, the women of the harem hide themselves in the veil, But if a harmless relative should come in, those covered ones will lift up their faceveils. Everything that is made beautiful and fair and lovely is made (so) for the eye of him that sees. How should the sound of melody and treble and bass be (made) for the insentient ear of one who is deaf?",8
"Not in vain did God make musk fragrant: He made it (so) for the sense (of smell), He did not make it for one whose nostrils are stopped (by disease). God hath fashioned the earth and the sky, He hath raised in the midst much fire and light. (He made) this earth for those (created) of clay, (He made) heaven to be the abode of the celestials. The low (base) man is the enemy of what is high: the purchaser (seeker) of each place (Heaven or Hell) is manifest (made known by his actions). O chaste woman, hast thou ever risen up and decked thyself for the sake of him that is blind?",8
"If I should fill the world with hidden pearls (of wisdom), how should I fare (what good would it do me), since they are not thy portion (since thou art unfit to receive them)? O wife, take leave of quarrelling and waylaying, and if thou wilt not, (then) take leave of me! What room have I for quarrelling with the good or the bad? —for this heart of mine is recoiling (even) from acts of peace. If thou keep silence, (’tis well), and if not, I will so do that at this very moment I will leave my house and home.” How the wife paid regard to her husband and begged God to forgive her for what she had said. When the wife saw that he was fierce and unmanageable, she began to weep: tears in sooth are a woman's lure.",8
"She said, “When did I imagine such (words) from thee? I hoped of thee something different.” The wife approached by the way of self-naughting (self-abasement). “I am thy dust,” said she, “not (worthy to be) thy lady- wife. Body and soul and all I am is thine: the entire authority and command belongs to thee. If because of poverty my heart has lost patience, it is not for my own sake, but for thine. Thou hast been my remedy in afflictions: I am unwilling that thou shouldst be penniless.",8
"On my soul and conscience, this is not for my own sake: this wailing and moaning is on account of thee. (I swear) by God that at every moment my self would fain die for thy self before thee. Would that thy soul, to which my soul is devoted, were aware of my soul's inmost thoughts! Inasmuch as thou hast such (an ill) opinion of me, I am grown weary both of soul and of body. I cast earth on (renounce) silver and gold, since thou behavest thus to me, O comfort of my soul.",8
"Thou who dwellest in my soul and heart, wilt thou declare thyself to be quit of me for this (small) amount (of offence)? Be quit (then)! for thou hast the power, (but) oh, my soul pleads against thy making this declaration. Remember the time when I was (beautiful) as the idol, and thou (adoring) as the idolater. Thy slave has kindled her heart (in eagerness) to comply with thee: whatever thou callest ‘cooked,’ she says it is ‘burnt.’ Whatever thou mayst cook me with, I am thy spinach: whether (thou art) sour broth (to me) or sweet, thou art worthy (of my affection).",8
"I uttered infidelity (blasphemy): lo, I have returned to the true faith, I am come (to submit) with all my soul to thy command. I did not know thy kingly nature, I rudely urged my beast (intruded) before thee. Since I have made (for myself) a lamp of thy forgiveness, I repent, I cast away (abandon) opposition. I am laying before thee sword and winding-sheet: I am bending my neck towards thee: smite! Thou art talking of bitter separation (from me): do whatever thou wilt, but do not this.",8
"Thy conscience within thee is a pleader on my behalf, it is a perpetual intercessor with thee in my absence. What pleads within thee for me is thy (noble) nature: from reliance on it my heart sought (to) sin (against thee). Have mercy, unbeknown to thyself (without any self-conceit), O angry one, O thou whose nature is better than a hundred maunds of honey.” In this fashion was she speaking graciously and winningly: meanwhile a (fit of) weeping came upon her. When the tears and sobs passed beyond bounds—from her who was fascinating even without tears—",8
"There appeared from that rain a lightning-flash (that) shot a spark of fire into the heart of the lonely man. She by whose beauteous face man was enslaved, how will it be when she begins to play the (humble) slave? She at whose haughtiness thy heart is trembling, how wilt thou fare when she falls aweeping before thee? She from whose disdain thy heart and soul are bleeding, how will it be when she turns to entreaty? She in whose tyranny and cruelty we are snared, what plea shall we have when she rises to plead?",8
"(The love of desired things, women, etc.) is decked out for men (made attractive to them): God has arranged it: how can they escape from what God has arranged? Inasmuch as He created her (the woman) that he (Adam) might take comfort in her, how can Adam be parted from Eve? Though he (the husband) be Rustam son of Zál and greater than Hamza (in valour), as regards authority he is his old woman's (his wife's) captive. He (the Prophet), to whose words the (whole) world was enslaved (obedient), used to cry, “Speak to me, O Humayrá!” The water prevailed over (extinguished) the fire by its dread onset, (but) the fire makes it seethe when it (the water) is screened (hidden in the cauldron).",8
"When a cauldron comes between (them), O king, it (the fire) annihilates the water and converts it into air. If outwardly thou art dominating thy wife, like the (fire-quenching) water, (yet) inwardly thou art dominated and art seeking (the love of) thy wife. This is characteristic of Man (alone): to the (other) animals love is wanting, and that (want of love) arises from (their) inferiority (to Man). Explanation of the Tradition, “Verily, they (women) prevail over the wise man, and the ignorant man prevails over them.” The Prophet said that woman prevails exceedingly over the wise and intelligent, (While), on the other hand, ignorant men prevail over woman, for in them the fierceness of the animal is imprisoned.",8
"They lack tenderness, kindness, and affection, because animality predominates over their (human) nature. Love and tenderness are human qualities, anger and lust are animal qualities. She (woman) is a ray of God, she is not that (earthly) beloved: she is creative, you might say she is not created. How the man yielded to his wife's request that he should seek the means of livelihood, and regarded her opposition (to him) as a Divine indication. (Verse): To the mind of every knowing man it is a fact that with the revolving object there is one that causes it to revolve. The man became as sorry for that speech (of his) as at the hour of death a tyrannical officer (is sorry) for his tyranny. He said, “How did I become the adversary of (her who is) the life of my soul? How did I bestow kicks on the head of my soul?”",8
"When the (Divine) destiny comes, it muffles the sight, so that our intellect cannot distinguish foot from head. As soon as the destiny is past, it (the intellect) devours itself (with grief): rending the veil (without regard for appearances), it tears its bosom. The man said, “O wife, I am repenting: if I have been an infidel, I will (now) become a Moslem. I am a sinner against thee: have mercy, do not dig me up all at once from root and foundation (do not bring me to utter ruin).” If the old infidel is repenting, he becomes a Moslem when he pleads for pardon.",8
"He (God) is the merciful and bountiful Lord: both existence and non-existence are in love with Him. (Both) infidelity and faith are lovers of that Majesty, both copper and silver are slaves to that Elixir. Explaining that both Moses and Pharaoh are subject to the Divine Will, like antidote and poison and darkness and light,and how Pharaoh conversed in solitude with God, praying that He would not destroy his (good) reputation. Moses and Pharaoh were servants (worshippers) of Reality, (though) outwardly the former keeps the way (is rightly guided), while the latter has lost the way. In the daytime Moses was making lament (supplication) to God: at midnight Pharaoh would begin to weep, Saying, “O God, what shackle is this on my neck? Were it not for the shackle, who would say ‘I am I’?",8
"By that (will) whereby Thou hast made Moses to be illumined, by that (same will) Thou hast made me to be darkened; By that whereby Thou hast made Moses' face like the moon Thou hast made the moon of my soul to be black-faced (eclipsed). My star was not better than a moon (so that it should be exempt from eclipse): since it has suffered eclipse, what help have I? If they beat drums in my honour (proclaiming me) as Lord and Sultan, (’tis like as when) the moon is eclipsed and the people beat bowls (of metal). They beat those bowls and raise a clamour: they put the moon to shame by their blows.",8
"I, who am Pharaoh, oh, woe is me because of (what is being done by) the people: my (title of) ‘My supreme Lord’ is (like) the blows on the bowl (since it proclaims my eclipse). We (Moses and I) are fellow-servants (to Thee), but Thy axe is cleaving the sappy boughs in Thy forest; Then it makes one bough to be firmly planted, another bough to be left uncared for. The bough has no power against the axe: no bough escaped from the power of the axe. (I entreat Thee) by the truth of the might which belongs to Thy axe, do Thou graciously make these crooked (perverse) actions (of ours) straight (righteous).”",8
"Once more Pharaoh said to himself, “Oh, wonderful! Am not I (occupied) the whole night in (crying) ‘O our Lord’? In secret I am growing humble and harmonious: when I reach Moses, how am I becoming (so different)? The colour (gilt) of base gold is (laid on) in ten coats: how is it becoming black-faced in the presence of the fire? Is it not (true) that my heart (spirit) and body are under His control, (so that) at one moment He makes me a kernel, at another moment a rind? When He bids me be a cornfield, I become green; when He bids me be ugly, I become yellow.",8
"At one moment He makes me a moon, at another black.” How, indeed, is the action of God other than this? Before the (blows of the) bat of His decree, “Be, and it was,” we are running (like balls) in Space and beyond. Since colourlessness (pure Unity) became the captive of colour (manifestation in the phenomenal world), a Moses came into conflict with a Moses. When you attain unto the colourlessness which you (originally) possessed, Moses and Pharaoh are at peace (with each other). If it occurs to you to ask questions about this mystery, (I reply), how should (the world of) colour be devoid of contradiction?",8
"The marvel is that this colour arose from that which is colourless: how did colour arise to war with the colourless? Inasmuch as oil has been formed (by God) from water, why have oil and water become opposites? Since the rose springs from the thorn, and the thorn from the rose, why are both of them at war and (engaged) in recrimination? Or is this not (really) war? Is it for (the Divine) purpose, (and is it) an artifice, like the bickering of those who sell asses? Or is it neither this nor that? Is it bewilderment? The treasure must be sought and this (bewilderment) is the ruin (where it is hidden).",8
"That which you imagine to be the treasure—through that vain imagination you are losing the treasure. Know that fancies and opinions are like the state of cultivation: treasure is not (to be found) in cultivated spots. In the state of cultivation there is existence and strife (contrariety): the non-existent is ashamed of (all) existent things. It is not the case that the existent implored help against (sought to escape from) nonexistence; nay, (’twas) the non-existent (that) repelled the existent. Do not say, “I am fleeing from the non-existent”; nay, it is fleeing from you. Stop! (Do not fancy yourself to be fleeing.)",8
"Outwardly it is calling you towards itself, but inwardly it is driving you away with the cudgel of rejection. O man of sound heart (mind), ’tis (a case of) reversed shoes: know that the rebelliousness of Pharaoh was (really) from (caused by) Moses. The reason why the unblest are disappointed of both worlds, (according to the text) “he has lost this life and the life tocome.” The wretched philosopher being firmly convinced that the sky is an egg and the earth like its yolk, Some one asked him how this earth remains, in the midst of this surrounding expanse of sky, Suspended in the air like a lamp, moving neither to the bottom nor to the top.",8
"The philosopher said to him, “It remains in the air because of the attraction exerted by the sky from (all) six directions. (The sky is) like a vault moulded (made) of lodestone: (the earth like) a suspended piece of iron remains in the middle.” Said the other, “How should the pure sky draw the dark earth to itself? Nay, it is repelling it (the earth) from (all) six directions: hence it (the earth) remains (suspended) amidst the violent winds (currents).” (Similarly), then, because of the repulsion exerted by the hearts of the perfect (saints), the spirits of Pharaohs remain in perdition.",8
"Therefore, through being rejected by this world and by that world, these lost ones have been left without either this or that. If you turn away your head from the (holy) servants of the Almighty, know that they are disgusted by your existence. They possess the amber: when they display it, they make the straw of your existence frenzied (with desire for it). When they conceal their amber, they quickly make your submission (to God) rebellion (against Him). That (position which you hold in relation to them) is like the stage of animality, which is captive and subject to (the stage of) humanity.",8
"Know that the stage of humanity is subject to the power of the saints as the animal (is subject to man), O master. Ahmad (Mohammed) in righteousness called (the people of) the whole world his servants: read (the text), “Say, O My servants.” Your intellect is like the camel-driver, and you are the camel: it drives you in every direction under its bitter control. The saints are the intellect of intellect, and (all) intellects (from the beginning) to the end are (under their control) like camels. Come now, look upon them with (profound) consideration: there is (but) one guide, and a hundred thousand souls (following him).",8
"What is the guide and what the camel-driver? Get thee an eye that may behold the Sun! Lo, the world has been left nailed fast in night, (while) day is waiting expectantly, depending on the sun. Here is a sun hidden in a mote, a fierce lion in the fleece of a lamb. Here is an ocean hidden beneath straw: beware, do not step on this straw with hesitancy. (But) a feeling of hesitancy and doubt in the heart (of the foolish) is a Divine mercy in regard to the (spiritual) guide.",8
"Every prophet came alone into this world: he was alone, and (yet) he had a hundred unseen worlds within him. By his power he enchanted the macrocosm (universe), he enfolded himself in a very small frame. The foolish deemed him to be lonely and weak: how is he weak who has become the King's companion? The foolish said, “He is a man, nothing more”: woe to him that recks not of the end! How the eyes of (external) sense regarded Sálih and his she-camel as despicable and without a champion; (for) when Godis about to destroy an army He makes their adversaries appear despicable and few in their sight, even though the adversarybe superior in strength: “and He was making you few in their eyes, that God might bring to pass a thing that was to bedone.” The she-camel of Sálih was in (outward) form a camel: that bitter (graceless) tribe hamstrung (and slaughtered) her in their folly.",8
"When they became her foes on account of the water (which she shared with them), they were blind to bread and blind to water (ungrateful for the blessings of God).God's she-camel drank water from brook and cloud: they (really) withheld God's water from God. The she-camel of Sálih became, like the bodies of righteous men, an ambush for the destruction of the wicked, That (you may see) what (the Divine command), Let God's she-camel have her portion of water, wrought against that people, through the ordainment of death and woe. The vengeance, which is God's minister, demanded from them an entire town as the blood-price of a single camel.",8
"His (the prophet's or saint's) spirit is like Sálih, and his body is the she-camel: the spirit is in union (with God), the body in want (distress). The Sálih-spirit is not susceptible to afflictions: the blows fall on the camel (body), not on the essence (spirit). No one gains victory over their (the saints') hearts: harm comes (only) to the oystershell, not to the pearl. The Sálih-spirit is not capable of being hurt: the light of God is not subject to infidels. The Soul (God) attached to it (the spirit) the earthly body, that they (the infidels) might hurt (it) and suffer tribulation,",8
"Not knowing that to hurt this (body) is to hurt (offend) Him: the water in this jar is joined with the water in the river. God connected (the spirit) with a body, in order that he (the prophet or saint) might become a refuge for the whole world. Be a slave to the camel, which is the saint's body, that you may become the fellow servant of the Sálih-spirit. Sálih said (to the people of Thamúd), “Inasmuch as ye have shown this envy, after three days the punishment will arrive from God. After three more days there will come from the Taker of life a calamity that hath three signs.",8
"The colour of all your faces will be changed, (they will be of) colours different to look at. On the first day your faces will be like saffron, on the second your faces will be red like arghawán (flowers of the Judas-tree). On the third, all your faces will become black: after that, the vengeance of God will arrive. If ye desire from me the sign of this threatened chastisement, the she-camel's foal has run towards the mountains: If ye can catch him, there is help (for you); else the bird of hope hath surely escaped from the snare.”",8
"None was able to overtake the foal: he went into the mountains and vanished. Sálih said, “Ye see, the (Divine) destiny has been ratified and has beheaded the phantom of your hope.” What is the she-camel's foal? His (the saint's) heart, which ye may bring back to its place (win again) by means of well-doing and piety. If his heart comes back (is reconciled), ye are saved from that (Divine punishment); otherwise ye are despairing and biting your fore-arms (in remorse). When they heard this dark threat, they cast down their eyes and waited for it (to be fulfilled).",8
"On the first day they saw their faces yellow: from despair they were sighing heavily. On the second day the faces of all became red: the time for hope and repentance was (irretrievably) lost. On the third day all their faces became black: the prediction of Sálih came true without (possibility of) dispute. When they all were cast away (and plunged) in despair, they fell on their knees, like (crouching) birds. Gabriel, the trusted (angel), brought in the Qur’án the description of this kneeling, (which is described by the word) játhimín.",8
"Do thou kneel at the time when they (the saints) are teaching thee and bidding thee dread such a kneeling as this. They (the people of Thamúd) were waiting for the stroke of vengeance: the vengeance came and annihilated this town. Sálih went from his solitude to the town: he beheld the town amidst (wrapt in) smoke and heat. He heard (the sound of) wailing from their limbs: the lamentation was plain (to hear), those who uttered it (were) invisible. He heard wailings from their bones: tears of blood (poured) from their spirits, like hailstones.",8
"Sálih heard that and set to weeping: he began to lament for them that made lamentation. He said, “O people that lived in vanity, and on account of you I wept before God! God said (to me), ‘Have patience with their iniquity: give them counsel, not much remains of their (allotted) period.’ I said, ‘Counsel is barred by ill-treatment: the milk of counsel gushes forth from love and joy. Much ill-treatment have they bestowed on me, (so that) the milk of counsel is curdled in my veins.’",8
"God said to me, ‘I will give thee a boon, I will lay a plaster on those wounds (of thine).’ God made my heart clear as the sky, He swept your oppression out of my mind. I went (back) once more to admonition, I spake parables and words (sweet) as sugar, I produced fresh milk from the sugar, I mingled milk and honey with my words. In you those words became like poison, because ye were filled with poison from the root and foundation.",8
"How should I be grieved that grief is overthrown? Ye were grief (to me), O obstinate people. Does any one lament the death of grief? Does any one tear out his hair when the sore on his head is removed?” (Then) he turned to himself and said, “O mourner, those folk are not worth thy mourning.” Recite correctly—do not regard my misquotation—(the words in the Qur’án) “Say, how shall I be grieved for an unjustpeople?” Again he felt a weeping in his eye and heart: an uncaused (involuntary) compassion shone forth in him.",8
"He was raining drops of water (shedding tears)—and he had become distraught— an uncaused drop from the Ocean of Bounty. His intellect was saying, “Wherefore is this weeping? Ought one to weep for such scoffers? Tell me, what art thou weeping for? For their fraud? For the host of their ill-shod (miserable) hatreds? For their murky hearts full of rust? For their venomous snake-like tongues? For their sagsár-like breath and teeth? For their mouths and eyes teeming with scorpions?",8
"For their wrangling and sneering and scoffing? Give thanks, since God has imprisoned (restrained) them. Their hands are perverse, their feet perverse, their eyes perverse, their love perverse, their peace perverse, their anger perverse.” For the sake of blind conformity and (for the sake of following) the standards of tradition, they set their feet (trampled) on the camels of Reason, the venerable guide. They were not eager for a guide (pír-khar): they all had become (like) an old donkey (pír khar) from paying hypocritical observance to each other's eyes and ears. God brought the (devout) worshippers from Paradise that He might show unto them the nurslings of Hell-fire. On the meaning of “He let the two seas go to meet one another: between them is a barrier which they do not seek (to cross).”",8
"Behold the people of (destined for) the Fire and those of Paradise dwelling in the same shop, (yet) between them is abarrier which they do not seek to cross.He hath mixed the people of the Fire and the people of the Light: between them He hath reared the mountain of Qáf. He hath mixed (them) like earth and gold in the mine: between them are a hundred deserts and caravanserays. (They are) mixed even as pearls and jet beads in the necklace, (soon to be parted) like guests of a single night. One half of the sea is sweet like sugar: the taste sweet, the colour bright as the moon.",8
"The other half is bitter as snake's venom: the taste bitter and the colour dark as pitch. Both (halves) dash against one another, from beneath and from the top, wave on wave like the water of the sea. The appearance of collision, (arising) from the narrow body, is (due to) the spirits' being intermingled in peace or war. The waves of peace dash against each other and root up hatreds from (men's) breasts. In other form do the waves of war turn (men's) loves upside down (confound and destroy them).",8
"Love is drawing the bitter ones to the sweet, because the foundation of (all) loves is righteousness. Wrath is carrying away the sweet one to bitterness: how should the bitter sort with (be suited to) the sweet? The bitter and the sweet are not visible to this (ocular) sight, (but) they can be seen through the window of the latter end. The eye that sees the end (ákhir) can see truly; the eye that sees (only) the stable (ákhur) is delusion and error. Oh, many the one that is sweet as sugar, but poison is concealed in the sugar.",8
"He that is more sagacious (than the rest) will know it by the smell; another (only) when it touches his lips and teeth: Then his lips will reject it before (it reaches) his throat, although the Devil is shouting, “Eat ye!” And to another it will declare (itself) in his throat, while to another it will unmask in his body; And to another it will give burning pain in evacuation: its outgoing will give him instruction as to its incoming (will show him what he has swallowed); And to another (it will become manifest) after days and months; and to another after death, from the depth of the grave;",8
"And if he be given a respite in the depth of the grave, (then) it will inevitably become manifest on the Day of Resurrection. Every piece of candy and sugar (desirable thing) in the world manifestly has a period granted to it from the revolution of Time. Years are needed in order that the ruby in (exposed to the rays of) the sun may obtain (the perfect) tint and splendour and brilliance. Vegetables, again, reach maturity in two months, while the red rose comes to perfection in a year. For this reason the Almighty and Glorious God in the Súratu ’l-An‘ám has made mention of an appointed term (ajal).",8
"You have heard this (discourse): may the whole of you, hair by hair, be an ear (to receive it)! ’Tis the Water of Life: (if) you have drunk, may it do you good! Call it the Water of Life, call it not a discourse: behold the new spirit in the body of the old letter! (Now), my friend, hearken to another saying (which is), like the soul, very clear (to mystics) and abstruse (to the rest): In a certain place (spiritual degree), through Divine dispositions even this poison and snake (worldliness and sensuality) is (rendered) digestible. In one place (it is) poison and in one place medicine, in one place infidelity and in one place approved.",8
"Although there it is injurious to the soul, when it arrives here it becomes a remedy. In the young grape (ghúra) the juice is sour, but it is sweet and good when the ghúra comes to be an angúr (ripe grape). Again in the wine-jar it becomes bitter and unlawful, (but) in the state (form) of vinegar how excellent it is as a seasoning! Concerning the impropriety of the disciple's (muríd) presuming to do the same things as are done by the saint (walí),inasmuch as sweetmeat does no harm to the physician, but is harmful to the sick, and frost and snow do no harm to the ripe grape, but are injurious to the young fruit; for he (the disciple) is (still) on the way, for he has not (yet) become (the saint to whom are applicable the words in the Qur’án): “That God may forgive thee thy former and latter sins.” If the saint drinks a poison it becomes an antidote, but if the seeker (disciple) drinks it, his mind is darkened. From Solomon have come the words, “O Lord, give me (a kingdom that it behoves not any one after me to obtain),” that is, “do not give this kingdom and power to any but me.",8
"Do not bestow this grace and bounty on any but me.” This looks like envy, but it was not that (in reality). Read with your soul the mystery of “it behoves not,” do not deem the inward meaning of “after me” (to be derived) from his (Solomon's) avarice. Nay, but in sovereignty he saw a hundred dangers: the kingdom of this world was (has ever been), hair by hair (in every respect), fear for one's head. Fear for head with fear for heart with fear for religion— there is no trial for us like this. Therefore one must needs possess the high aspiration of a Solomon in order to escape from these myriads of colours and perfumes (enticing vanities).",8
"Even with such (great) strength (of spirit) as he had, the waves of that (worldly) kingdom were stifling his breath (choking him). Since dust settled on him from this sorrow, he had compassion for all the kings of the world. Hence he interceded (with God on their behalf) and said, “Give this kingdom (to them) with (accompanied by) the (spiritual) perfection which Thou hast given to me. To whomsoever Thou wilt give (it), and (on whomsoever) Thou wilt confer that bounty, he (that person) is Solomon, and I also am he. He is not ‘after me,’ he is with me. What of ‘with me,’ indeed? I am without rival.”",8
"’Tis my duty to explain this, but (now) I will return to the story of the man and wife. The moral of the altercation of the Arab and his wife. The heart of one who is sincere is seeking (to find) a moral for the altercation of the man and wife. The altercation of the man and wife has been related (as a story): know that it is a parable of your own flesh (nafs) and reason. This man and wife, which are the flesh and the reason, are very necessary for (the manifestation of) good and evil; And this necessary pair in this house of earth are (engaged) in strife and altercation day and night.",8
"The wife is craving requisites for the household, that is to say, reputation and bread and viands and rank. Like the wife, the flesh, in order to contrive the means (of gratifying its desires), is at one time seeking (having recourse to) humility and at another time to domination. The reason is really unconscious of these (worldly) thoughts: in its brain is nothing but love of God. Although the inner meaning of the tale is this bait and trap, listen now to the outward form of the tale in its entirety. If the spiritual explanation were sufficient, the creation of the world would have been vain and idle.",8
"If love were (only spiritual) thought and reality, the form of your fasting and prayer would be non-existent. The gifts of lovers to one another are, in respect of love, naught but forms; (But the purpose is) that the gifts may have borne testimony to feelings of love which are concealed in secrecy, Because outward acts of kindness bear witness to feelings of love in the heart, O dear friend. Your witness is sometimes true, sometimes false, sometimes drunken with wine, sometimes with sour curds.",8
"He that has drunk sour curds makes a show of intoxication, shouts ecstatically, and behaves like one whose head is heavy (with the fumes of wine); That hypocrite is (assiduous) in fasting and praying, in order that it may be supposed that he is drunken with devotion (to God). In short, external acts are different (from internal feelings), (and their purpose is) to indicate that which is hidden. O Lord, grant us according to our desire such discernment that we may know the false indication from the true. Do you know how the sense-perception becomes discerning? In this way, that the sense-perception should be seeing by the light of God.",8
"And if there be no effect (outward sign), the cause too makes manifest (that which is hidden), as (for example) kinship gives information concerning love (enables you to infer the presence of love). When the light of God comes into the sensorium (and becomes the medium of perception), you will not be a slave to effect or cause— So that Love will throw a spark within, wax mighty, and make (the illumined one) independent of effect. He has no need for the signs of love, since Love has shot its radiance over the sky (of his heart). There are detailed explanations (which I could give) in order to complete this subject; but seek them (for yourself), and (now) farewell.",8
"And as for him that perceived the inner meaning in this outward form, the form is (both) near to the meaning and far (from it). In regard to indication, they (the meaning and the form) are like the sap and the tree; (but) when you turn to the quiddity, they are very far (removed from each other). (Let me) take leave of quiddities and essential properties, and relate what happened to those twain with faces like the moon. How the Arab set his heart on (complying with) his beloved's request and swore that in thus submitting (to her) he had no (idea of) trickery and making trial (of her). The man said, “Now I have ceased to oppose (thee): thou hast authority (to do what thou wilt): draw the sword from the sheath. Whatsoever thou biddest me do, I will obey: I will not consider the bad or good result of it.",8
"I will become non-existent in thy existence, because I am thy lover: love makes blind and deaf.” The wife said, “Oh, I wonder if thou art (really) my friend, or whether thou art (bent on) discovering my secret by trickery?” He said, “(No), by God who knows the thought most deeply hid, who out of dust created Adam pure (chosen above all), Who, in the body three cubits long which He gave him, displayed everything that was contained in the tablets (of destiny) and the (world of) spirits. Through his He (God) taught him (Adam) the Names (through his God-given knowledge) he at the very first gave instruction (to the angels) concerning everything that shall come to pass unto everlasting,",8
"So that the angels became beside themselves (in amazement) at his teaching, and gained from his glorification (of God) a holiness other (than they possessed before). The revelation that appeared to them from Adam was not (contained) in the amplitude of their heavens. In comparison with the spaciousness of the range of that pure spirit (Adam), the expanse of the seven heavens became narrow. The Prophet said that God has said, ‘I am not contained in the jar of “high” and “low” (spatial dimensions); I am not contained in earth or heaven or even in the empyrean—know this for certain, O noble one;",8
"(But) I am contained in the true believer's heart: oh, how wonderful! If thou seekest Me, search in those hearts.’ He (God) said (also), ‘Enter among My servants, thou wilt meet with a Paradise (consisting) of vision of Me, O God-fearing one.’ The empyrean, notwithstanding its wide (far-extending) light, when it beheld that (spirit of Adam), was confounded. Truly, the magnitude of the empyrean is very great, but who (what) is form when reality has arrived? Then the angels were saying (to Adam), ‘Before this (time) we had a friendship (with thee) on the dust of the earth.",8
"On the earth we were sowing the seed of service (worship): we were marveling at that connexion, Marvelling what connexion we had with that dust, inasmuch as our nature is of heaven. (We said), Why (this) friendship in us, who are light, with darkness? How can light live with darkness? O Adam, that friendship was owing to the scent of thee, because earth was the woof and warp of thy body. From this place (the earth) thy earthly body was woven, in this place thy pure light was found.",8
"This (light) that our souls have obtained from thy spirit shone erstwhile from the dust. We were in the earth, and heedless of the earth, heedless of the treasure that lay buried there. When He (God) bade us journey from that place of abode our palates were soured (we were bitterly grieved) by the change, So that we were arguing (and saying), ‘O God, who will come in our stead? Wilt Thou sell the splendour of the praise with which we glorify and magnify Thee for babble and palaver?’",8
"The decree of God spread for us the carpet (of indulgence), (and He said), ‘Speak ye, in the way of boldness (And) without fear, whatever comes upon your tongues, like only children with their father; For what if these words (of yours) are unseemly? My mercy likewise is prior (superior) to My wrath. In order to manifest this priority, O angel, I will put in thee incitement to perplexity and doubt, That thou mayst speak and I not take offence at thee, (so that) none who denies My clemency may dare to utter a word.",8
"Within My (infinite) clemency (the clemencies of) a hundred fathers and a hundred mothers at every moment are born and vanish. Their clemency is (but) the foam of the sea of My clemency: the foam comes and goes, but the sea is (always) there.’’ What indeed shall I say? Compared with that pearl (Divine clemency) this oyster-shell (human clemency) is naught but the foam of the foam of the foam of foam. By the truth of that foam, by the truth of that pure sea, (I swear) that these words (of mine) are not (meant to make) trial of thee and are not vain. They are from (inspired by) love and sincerity and humbleness, (I swear) by the truth of that One to whom I turn.",8
"If this affection (which I am showing) seems to thee a trial, do thou for one moment put the (supposed) trial (of thee) to the test. Do not hide thy secret (but reveal it), in order that mine may be revealed: command anything that I am able to do. Do not hide thy heart (but reveal it), in order that mine may be revealed and that I may accept whatever I am capable of (performing). How shall I do? What remedy is in my power? Look what a plight my soul is in.” How the wife specified to her husband the way to earn daily bread and how he accepted (her proposal). The wife said, “A sun has shone forth, a (whole) world has received light from him—",8
"The Vicar of the Merciful (God), the Khalífa of the Creator: through him the city of Baghdád is (gay and happy) as the season of spring. If thou gain access to that King, thou wilt become a king: how long wilt thou go after every (kind of) misfortune?” Companionship with the fortunate is like the Elixir: indeed, how is an Elixir like (to be compared with) their looks (of favour)? The eye of Ahmad (Mohammed) was cast upon an Abú Bakr: he by a single act of faith became a Siddíq. Said the husband, “How should I go to meet the King? How should I go to him without a pretext?",8
"I must have some reference or device: is any handicraft right (possible) without tools? As (to mention a similar case) the famous Majnún, when he heard from some one that Laylá was a little unwell, Cried, ‘Ah, how shall I go (to her) without a pretext? And if I fail to visit her when she is ill, how (wretched) shall I be! Would that I were a skilled physician! I would have gone on foot to Laylá first of all (before any one else).’ God said to us, ‘Say, Come ye,’ in order to signify to us the (means of) vanquishing our feeling of shame.",8
"If bats had sight and means (ability to bear the sunshine), they would fly about and enjoy themselves by day.” The wife said, “When the gracious King goes into the field (maydán), the essence of every lack of means (inability) becomes a means (ability), Because the means (ability) is (involves) pretension and self-existence: the (pith of the) matter lies in lack of means (inability) and non-existence.” “How,” said he, “should I do business without means, unless I make it manifest that I (really) have no means? Therefore I must needs have attestation of my want of means, that he (the King) may pity me in want.",8
"Do thou produce some attestation besides talk and show, so that the beauteous King may take pity, For the testimony that consisted of talk and show was (ever) invalidated before that Supreme Judge. He requires truth (veracity) as witness to his (the indigent man's) state, so that his (inner) light shall shine forth (and proclaim his indigence) without any words of his.” How the Arab carried a jug of rain-water from the midst of the desert as a gift to the Commander of the Faithful atBaghdád, in the belief that in that town also there was a scarcity of water. The wifè said, “When people with all their might (endeavour to) rise up entirely purged of self-existence—that is veracity. We have the rain-water in the jug: ’tis thy property and capital and means. ",8
"Take this jug of water and depart, make it a gift and go into the presence of the King of kings. Say, ‘We have no means except this: in the desert there is nothing better than this water.’ If his treasury is full of gold and jewels, (yet) he does not get water like this: ’tis rare.” What is that jug? Our confined body: within it is the briny water of our senses. O Lord, accept this jar and jug of mine by the grace of “God hath purchased (from the believers their lives and wealth in return for Paradise).”",8
"(’Tis) a jug with five spouts, the five senses: keep this water pure (and safe) from every filth, That there may be from this jug a passage to the sea, and that my jug may assume the nature of the sea, So that when you carry it as a gift to the King, the King may find it pure and be its purchaser; (And) after that, its water will become without end: a hundred worlds will be filled from my jug. Stop up its spouts and keep it filled (with water) from the jar (of Reality): God said, “Close your eyes to vain desire.”",8
"His (the husband's) beard was full of wind (he was puffed up with pride): “Who (thought he) has such a gift as this? This, truly, is worthy of a King like him.” The wife did not know that in that place (Baghdád) on the thoroughfare there is the great stream (of water) sweet as sugar, Flowing like a sea through the city, full of boats and fishing-nets. Go to the Sultan and behold this pomp and state! Behold the senses of (those for whom God hath prepared gardens) beneath which the rivers flow! Our senses and perceptions, such as they are, are (but) a single drop in those rivers. How the Arab's wife sewed the jug of rain-water in a felt cloth and put a seal on it because of the Arab's utter conviction(that it was a precious gift for the King).",8
"“Yes,” said the husband, “stop up the mouth of the jug. Take care, for this is a gift that will bring us profit. Sew this jug in felt, that the King may break his fast with our gift, For there is no (water) like this in all the world: no (other) water is so pure as this.” (This he said) because they (people like him) are always full of infirmity and half-blind from (drinking) bitter and briny waters. The bird whose dwelling-place is the briny water, how should it know where to find in it the clear (and sweet) water?",8
"O thou whose abode is in the briny spring, how shouldst thou know the Shatt and the Jayhún and the Euphrates? O thou who hast not escaped from this fleeting caravanseray (the material world), how shouldst thou know (the meaning of) “self-extinction” and (mystical) “intoxication” and “expansion”? And if thou knowest, ’tis (by rote, like the knowledge) handed down to thee from father and grandfather: to thee these names are like abjad. How plain and evident to all children are abjad and hawwaz, and (yet) the real meaning is far away (hard to reach). Then the Arab man took up the jug and set out to journey, carrying it along (with him) day and night.",8
"He was trembling for the jug, in fear of Fortune's mischiefs: all the same, he conveyed it from the desert to the city (Baghdád). His wife unrolled the prayer-rug in supplication; she made (the words) Rabbi sallim (Save, O Lord) her litany in prayer, Crying, “Keep our water safe from scoundrels! O Lord, let that pearl arrive at that sea! Although my husband is shrewd and artful, yet the pearl has thousands of enemies. Pearl indeed! ’Tis the water of Kawthar: ’tis a drop of this that is the origin of the pearl.”",8
"Through the prayers and lamentation of the wife, and through the husband's anxiety and his patience under the heavy burden, He bore it without delay, safe from robbers and unhurt by stones, to the seat of the Caliphate (the Caliph's palace). He saw a bountiful Court, (where) the needy had spread their nets; Everywhere, moment by moment, some petitioner gained (and carried away) from that Court a donation and robe of honour: ’Twas like sun and rain, nay, like Paradise, for infidel and true believer and good folk and bad.",8
"He beheld some people arrayed (with favour) in the sight (of the Caliph), and others who had risen to their feet (and were) waiting (to receive his commands). High and low, from Solomon to the ant, they (all) had become quickened with life, like the world at the blast of the trumpet (on the Day of Resurrection). The followers of Form were woven (entangled) in pearls, the followers of Reality had found the Sea of Reality. Those without aspiration—how aspiring had they become! and those of high aspiration—to what felicity had they attained! Showing that, as the beggar is in love with bounty and in love with the bountiful giver, so the bounty of the bountiful giveris in love with the beggar: if the beggar have the greater patience, the bountiful giver will come to his door; and if the bountiful giver have the greater patience, the beggar will come to his door; but the beggar's patience is a virtue in the beggar, while the patience of the bountiful giver is in him a defect. A loud call was coming (to his ears): “Come, O seeker! Bounty is in need of beggars: (it is needy) like a beggar.",8
"Bounty is seeking the beggars and the poor, just as fair ones who seek a clear mirror. The face of the fair is made beautiful by the mirror, the face of Beneficence is made visible by the beggar. Therefore on this account God said in the Súra ?a’d-Duhá, “O Mohammed, do not shout at (and drive away) the beggar.” Inasmuch as the beggar is the mirror of Bounty, take care! Breath is hurtful to the face of the mirror. In the one case, his (the giver's) bounty makes the beggar manifest (causes him to beg), while in the other case he (the giver), (without being asked), bestows on the beggars more (than they need).",8
"Beggars, then, are the mirror of God's bounty, and they that are with God are (united with) the Absolute Bounty; And every one except those two (types of beggar) is truly a dead man: he is not at this door (the Divine Court), he is (lifeless as) a picture (embroidered) on a curtain. The difference between one that is poor for (desirous of) God and thirsting for Him and one that is poor of (destitute of)God and thirsting for what is other than He. He (that seeks other than God) is the (mere) picture of a dervish, he is not worthy of bread (Divine bounty): do not throw bread to the picture of a dog! He wants a morsel of food, he does not want God: do not set dishes before a lifeless picture! The dervish that wants bread is a land-fish: (he has) the form of a fish, but (he is) fleeing from the sea.",8
"He is a domestic fowl, not the Símurgh of the air: he swallows sweet morsels (of food), he does not eat from God. He loves God for the sake of gain: his soul is not in love with (God's) excellence and beauty. If he conceives that he is in love with the Essence (of God), conception of the (Divine) names and attributes is not the Essence. Conception is begotten of qualities and definition: God is not begotten, He is lam yúlad. How should he that is in love with his own imagination and conception be one of them that love the Lord of bounties?",8
"If the lover of that (false) conception be sincere, that metaphor (unreal judgement) will lead him to the reality. The exposition of this saying demands a commentary, but I am afraid of senile (feeble) minds. Senile and short-sighted minds bring a hundred evil fancies into their thoughts. Not every one is able to hear rightly: the fig is not a morsel for every little bird, Especially a bird that is dead, putrid; a blind, eyeless (fellow) filled with vain fancy.",8
"To the picture of a fish what is the difference between sea and land? To the colour of a Hindoo what is the difference between soap and black vitriol? If you depict the portrait on the paper as sorrowful, it has no lesson (learns nothing) of sorrow or joy. Its appearance is sorrowful, but it is free from that (sorrow); (or) its appearance is smiling, but it has no (inward) impression of that (joy). And this (worldly) sorrow and joy which are delineated in the heart are naught but a picture in comparison with that (spiritual) joy and sorrow. The picture's smiling appearance is for your sake, in order that by means of that picture the reality may be established (rightly understood by you).",8
"The pictures (phenomena) which are in these hot baths (the world), (when viewed) from outside the undressing-room (of self-abandonment), are like clothes. So long as you are outside, you see only the clothes (phenomena): put off your clothes and enter (the bath of reality), O kindred spirit, Because, with your clothes, there is no way (of getting) inside: the body is ignorant of the soul, the clothes (are ignorant) of the body. How the Caliph's officers and chamberlains came forward to pay their respects to the Bedouin and to receive his gift. When the Bedouin arrived from the remote desert to the gate of the Caliph's palace, The court officers went to meet the Bedouin: they sprinkled much rose-water of graciousness on his bosom.",8
"Without speech (on his part) they perceived what he wanted: it was their practice to give before being asked. Then they said to him, “O chief of the Arabs, whence dost thou come? How art thou after the journey and fatigue?” He said, “I am a chief, if ye give me any countenance (favour); I am without means (of winning respect) when ye put me behind your backs. O ye in whose faces are the marks of eminence, O ye whose splendour is more pleasing than the gold of Ja‘far, O ye, one sight of whom is (worth many) sights, O ye at the sight of whom pieces of gold are scattered (as largesse),",8
"O ye, all of whom have become seeing by the light of God, who have come from God for the sake of munificence, That ye may cast the elixir of your looks upon the copper of human individuals, I am a stranger: I have come from the desert: I have come in hope of (gaining) the grace of the Sultan. The scent of his grace covered (took entire possession of) the deserts: even the grains of sand were ensouled (thereby).I came all the way to this place for the sake of dinars: as soon as I arrived, I became drunken with sight (contemplation).”",8
"A person ran to the baker for bread: on seeing the beauty of the baker, he gave up the ghost. A certain man went to the rose-garden to take his pleasure, and found it in the beauty of the gardener, Like the desert Arab who drew water from the well and tasted the Water of Life from the (lovely) face of Joseph. Moses went to fetch fire: he beheld such a Fire (the Burning Bush) that he escaped from (searching after) fire. Jesus sprang up, to escape from his enemies: that spring carried him to the Fourth Heaven.",8
"The ear of wheat became a trap for Adam, so that his existence became the wheat-ear (seed and origin) of mankind. The falcon comes to the snare for food: it finds the fore-arm (wrist) of the King and fortune and glory. The child went to school to acquire knowledge, in hope of (getting) its father's pretty bird (as a prize); Then, by (going to) school, that child rose to the top, paid monthly fees (to his teacher), and became perfect (in knowledge). ‘Abbás had come to war for vengeance’ sake, for the purpose of subduing Ahmad (Mohammed) and opposing the (true) religion:",8
"He and his descendants in the Caliphate became a back and front (complete support) to the (true) religion until the Resurrection. “I came to this court in quest of wealth: as soon as I entered the portico I became (a spiritual) chief. I brought water as a gift for the sake of (getting) bread: hope of bread led me to the highest place in Paradise. Bread drove an Adam forth from Paradise: bread caused me to mix (made me consort) with those who belong to Paradise. I have been freed, like the angels, from water and bread (materiality): without (any worldly) object of desire I move round this court, like the (revolving) sphere of heaven.”",8
"Nothing in the world is without object (disinterested) in its movement (activity) except the bodies and the souls of (God's) lovers. Showing that the lover of this world is like the lover of a wall on which the sunbeams strike, who makes no effort andexertion to perceive that the radiance and splendour do not proceed from the wall, but from the orb of the sun in theFourth Heaven; consequently he sets his whole heart on the wall, and when the sunbeams rejoin the sun (at sunset), he isleft for ever in despair: “and a bar is placed between them and that which they desire.” The lovers of the Whole are not those who love the part: he that longed for the part failed to attain unto the Whole. When a part falls in love with a part, the object of its love soon goes (returns) to its own whole. He (the lover of the particular) became the laughing-stock of another's slave: he became (like a man who was) drowning and clung to some one weak (and powerless to help him). He (the loved slave) possesses no authority, that he should care for him: shall he do his own master's business or his (the lover's)? The Arabic proverb, “If you commit fornication, commit it with a free woman, and if you steal, steal a pearl.”",8
"Hence (the saying), “Commit fornication with a free woman,” became proverbial; (and the words) “steal a pearl” were transferred (metaphorically) to this (meaning). The slave (the loved one) went away to his master: he (the lover) was left in misery. The scent of the rose went (back) to the rose: he was left with the thorn. He was left far from the object of his desire—his labour lost, his toil useless, his foot wounded, Like the hunter who catches a shadow—how should the shadow become his property? The man has grasped tightly the shadow of a bird, (while) the bird on the branch of the tree is fallen into amazement,",8
"(Thinking), “I wonder who this crack-brained fellow is laughing at? Here's folly for you, here's a rotten cause!” And if you say that the part is connected with the whole, (then) eat thorns: the thorn is connected with the rose. Except from one point of view, it (the part) is not connected with the whole: otherwise, indeed, the mission of the prophets would be vain, Inasmuch as the prophets are (sent) in order to connect (the part with the whole): how, then, should they (the prophets) connect them when they are (already) one body? This discourse hath no end. O lad, the day is late: conclude the tale. How the Arab delivered the gift, that is, the jug to the Caliph's servants.",8
"He presented the jug of water, he sowed the seed of homage in that (exalted) court. “Bear this gift,” said he, “to the Sultan, redeem the King's suitor from indigence. ’Tis sweet water and a new green jug—some of the rain-water that collected in the ditch.” The officials smiled at that, but they accepted it (the jug) as (though it were precious as) life, Because the graciousness of the good and wise King had made a mark (impressed itself) on all the courtiers.",8
"The disposition of kings settles (becomes implanted) in their subjects: the green sky makes the earth verdant. Regard the king as a reservoir with pipes in every direction, and water running from all (the pipes) like hoppers (in a mill). When the water in all (the pipes) is from a pure reservoir, every single one gives sweet water, pleasant to taste; But if the water in the reservoir is brackish and dirty, every pipe brings the same to view, Because every pipe is connected with the reservoir. Dive, dive into (ponder deeply) the meaning of these words.",8
"(Consider) how the imperial grace of the homeless Spirit has produced effects on the whole body; How the grace of Reason, which is of goodly nature, of goodly lineage, brings the entire body into discipline; How Love, saucy, uncontrolled, and restless, throws the whole body into madness. The purity of the water of the Sea that is like Kawthar (is such that) all its pebbles are pearls and gems. For whatever science the master is renowned, the souls of his pupils become endued with the same.",8
"With the master-theologian the quick and industrious pupil reads (scholastic) theology. With the master-jurist the student of jurisprudence reads jurisprudence, when he (the teacher) expounds it, not theology. Then the master who is a grammarian—the soul of his pupil becomes imbued by him with grammar. Again, the master who is absorbed in the Way (of Súfism)— because of him the soul of his pupil is absorbed in the King (God). Of all these various kinds of knowledge, on the day of death the (best) equipment and provision for the road is the knowledge of (spiritual) poverty. The story of what passed between the grammarian and the boatman.",8
"A certain grammarian embarked in a boat. That self-conceited person turned to the boatman And said, “Have you ever studied grammar?” “No,” he replied. The other said, “Half your life is gone to naught.” The boatman became heart-broken with grief, but at the time he refrained from answering. The wind cast the boat into a whirlpool: the boatman spoke loud (shouted) to the grammarian, “Tell me, do you know how to swim?” “No,” said he, “O fair-spoken good-looking man!”",8
"“O grammarian,” said he, “your whole life is naught, because the boat is sinking in these whirlpools.” Know that here mahw (self-effacement) is needed, not nah? (grammar): if you are mahw (dead to self), plunge into the sea without peril. The water of the sea places the dead one on its head (causes him to float on the surface); but if he be living, how shall he escape from the sea? Inasmuch as you have died to the attributes of the flesh, the Sea of (Divine) consciousness will place you on the crown of its head (will raise you to honour). (But) O thou who hast called the people asses, at this time thou art left (floundering), like an ass, upon this ice.",8
"If in the world thou art the most learned scholar of the time, behold the passing away of this world and this time! We have stitched in (inserted) the (story of the) grammarian, that we might teach you the grammar (nahw) of self-effacement (mahw). In self-loss, O venerated friend, thou wilt find the jurisprudence of jurisprudence, the grammar of grammar, and the accidence of accidence. That jug of water is (an emblem of) our different sorts of knowledge, and the Caliph is the Tigris of God's knowledge. We are carrying jugs full (of water) to the Tigris: if we do not know ourselves to be asses, asses we are.",8
"After all, the Bedouin was excusable, for he was ignorant of the Tigris and of the (great) river. If he had been acquainted with the Tigris, as we are, he would not have carried that jug from place to place; Nay, had he been aware of the Tigris, he would have dashed that jug against a stone. How the Caliph accepted the gift and bestowed largesse, notwithstanding that he was entirely without need of the gift (thewater) and the jug. When the Caliph saw (the gift) and heard his story, he filled the jug with gold and added (other presents). He delivered the Arab from penury, he bestowed donations and special robes of honour,",8
"Saying, “Give into his hand this jug full of gold. When he returns (home), take him to the Tigris. He has come (hither) by way of the desert and by travelling (on land): it will be nearer for him (to return) by water.” When he (the Arab) embarked in the boat and beheld the Tigris, he was prostrating himself in shame and bowing (his head), Saying, “Oh, wonderful is the kindness of that bounteous King, and ’tis (even) more wonderful that he took that water. How did that Sea of munificence so quickly accept from me such spurious coin as this?”",8
"Know, O son, that everything in the universe is a jug which is (filled) to the brim with wisdom and beauty. It (everything in the universe) is a drop of the Tigris of His beauty, which (beauty) because of its fullness is not contained under the skin (that should enclose it). ’Twas a hidden treasure: because of its fullness it burst forth and made the earth more shining than the heavens.’Twas a hidden treasure: because of its fullness it surged up and made the earth (like) a sultan robed in satin. And if he (the Arab) had seen a branch of the Divine Tigris, he would have destroyed that jug, destroyed it.",8
"They that saw it are always beside themselves: like one beside himself, they hurled a stone at the jug (of their self- existence). O thou who from jealousy hast hurled a stone at the jug, while the jug has (only) become more perfect through being shattered, The jar is shattered, (but) the water is not spilled from it: from this shattering have arisen a hundred soundnesses. Every piece of the jar is in dance and ecstasy, (though) to the partial (discursive) reason this seems absurd. In this state (of ecstasy) neither the jug is manifest nor the water. Consider well, and God knoweth best what is right.",8
"When you knock at the door of Reality, it will be opened to you: beat the pinion of thought, in order that you may be made a king-falcon. The pinion of your thought has become mud-stained and heavy because you are a clayeater: clay has become to you as bread. Bread and meat are (originally) clay: eat little thereof, that you may not remain in the earth, like clay. When you become hungry, you become a dog: you become fierce and ill-tempered and ill-natured. When you have eaten your fill, you have become a carcase: you have become devoid of understanding and without feet (inert), like a wall.",8
"So at one time you are a carcase and at another time a dog: how will you run well in the road of the lions (follow the saints)? Know that your only means of hunting is the dog (the animal soul): throw bones to the dog but seldom, Because when the dog has eaten its fill, it becomes rebellious: how should it run to the goodly chase and hunt? Want of food was leading the Arab to that (exalted) court, and (there) he found his fortune. We have related in the (foregoing) story the kindness shown by the King to that needy one who had no refuge.",8
"Whatsoever the man in love (with God) speaks, the scent of Love is springing from his mouth into the abode of Love. If he speak (formal) theology, it all turns to (spiritual) poverty: the scent of poverty comes from that man of sweet and beguiling discourse. And if he speak infidelity, it has the scent of (the true) religion, and if he speak doubtfully, his doubt turns to certainty. The perverse froth that has risen from a sea of sincerity— that turbid (froth) has been set out by the pure source. Know that its froth is pure and worthy: know that it is like revilement from the lips of the beloved,",8
"Whose unsought reproaches have become sweet (to the lover) for the sake of her cheek which he desires. If he (the lover of God) speak falsehood, it seems (like) the truth. O (fine) falsehood that would adorn (even) the truth! If you cook (a confection) of sugar in the form of a loaf of bread, it will taste of candy, not of bread, while you are sucking it. If a true believer find a golden idol, how should he leave it (there) for the sake of a worshipper? Nay, he will take it and cast it into the fire: he will break (destroy) its borrowed (unreal) form,",8
"In order that the idol-shape may not remain on the gold, because Form hinders and waylays (those who seek Reality). The essence of its gold is the essence of Lordship (Divinity): the idol-stamp on the sterling gold is borrowed (unreal). Do not burn a blanket on account of a flea, and do not let the day go (to waste) on account of every gnat's headache. You are an idol-worshipper when you remain in (bondage to) forms: leave its (the idol's) form and look at the reality. If you are a man (bound) for the Pilgrimage, seek a pilgrim (as your) companion, whether he be a Hindoo or a Turcoman or an Arab.",8
"Do not look at his figure and colour, look at his purpose and intention. If he is black, (yet) he is in accord with you: call him white, for (spiritually) his complexion is the same as yours. This story has been told up and down (confusedly), like the doings of lovers, without foot (end) or head (beginning). It hath no head, inasmuch as it existed before eternity; it hath no foot: it has (always) been akin to everlastingness. Nay, it is like water: every drop thereof is both head and foot, and at the same time without both.",8
"This is not a story, mark you! God forbid! This is the ready money (presentation, here and now) of my state and yours. Consider (it) well, Because the Súfí is grand and glorious (in his spiritual vision): whatever is past is not remembered (does not enter his mind). We are both the Arab and the jug and the King; we are all: he that has been turned away from it (the Truth) shall be turnedaway. Know that the husband is Reason, and the wife is greed and cupidity: these twain are dark and deniers (of Reason); Reason is the (bright) candle. Now hear the origin of their denial, whence it arose: (it arose) from the fact that the Whole hath various parts.",8
"The parts of the Whole are not parts in relation to the Whole — (they are) not like the scent of the rose, which is a part of the rose. The beauty of (all) green herbs is a part of the Rose's beauty, the coo of the turtle-dove is a part of that Nightingale. If I become occupied with a difficulty (difficult question) and the answer (explanation), how shall I be able to give water to the thirsty? If you are wholly perplexed and in straits, have patience: patience is the key to joy. Abstain from (distracting) thoughts, abstain: thought is (like) the lion and the wild ass, and (men's) hearts are the thickets (which they haunt).",8
"Acts of abstinence are superior to medicines, because scratching is an increase (aggravation) of the itch. Assuredly abstinence is the first principle of medicine: abstain, and behold the strength of the spirit. Receive these words, like the (open) ear, that I may make for you an earring of gold: (Then) you will become a ring in the ear of (devoted to) the Moon that works in gold, you will ascend to the moon and the Pleiades. First, hear (and learn) that the diverse created beings are spiritually different, from yá (Y) to alif (A).",8
"Amongst the various letters there is a confusion and uncertainty, though from one point of view they are (all) one from head (beginning) to foot (end). From one aspect they are opposites, and from one aspect they are unified; from one aspect they are jest, and from one aspect they are earnest. Therefore the Resurrection is the day of the supreme inspection: inspection is desired by him (only) who is glorious and splendid. Whoever is like a fraudulent Hindoo, for him the day of inspection is the time of exposure. Inasmuch as he hath not a face like the sun, he desires nothing but night (to cover him) like a veil.",8
"Since his thorn hath not a single rose-leaf, Spring is the enemy of his conscience, While to one that is roses and lilies from head to foot Spring is (welcome as) a pair of bright eyes. The unspiritual thorn wishes for autumn, for autumn, in order that it may jostle with (contend as a rival with) the rose-garden, And that it (autumn) may hide the beauty of that (the rose) and the shame of this (the thorn), so that you may not see the colour of that and the colour of this. Therefore autumn is its (the thorn's) Spring and life, (for then) the (worthless) stone and the pure ruby appear one.",8
"The Gardener knows that (difference) even in autumn, but the One's sight is better than the world's sight. Truly that One Person is (essentially) the (whole) world: he is unaware of evil (does not know evil as such). The stars, every one, are all part of the Moon. Therefore every fair form and shape (in the world) is crying, “Good news! good news! Lo, here comes the Spring.” So long as the blossom is shining like a coat of mail, how should the fruits display their knobs? When the blossom is shed, the fruit comes to a head: when the body is shattered, the spirit lifts up its head.",8
"The fruit is the reality, the blossom is its form: the blossom is the good news, the fruit is the bounty (given as a reward) for it. When the blossom was shed, the fruit became visible: when that diminished this began to increase. How should bread give strength until it is broken? How should uncrushed clusters (of grapes) yield wine? Unless myrobalan is pounded up with medicines, how should the medicines by themselves become health-increasing (act as tonics)? Concerning the qualities of the Pír (Spiritual Guide) and (the duty of) obedience to him. O Splendour of the Truth, Husámu’ddín, take one or two sheets of paper and add (them to the poem) in description of the Pír.",8
"Although thy slender body hath no strength, yet without the sun (of thy spirit) we have no light. Although thou hast become the lighted wick and the glass (lamp), yet thou art the heart's leader (the Spiritual Guide): thou art the end of the thread (which serves as a clue). Inasmuch as the end of the thread is in thy hand and will, the beads (of spiritual knowledge) on the heart's necklace are (derived) from thy bounty. Write down what appertains to the Pír (Guide) who knows the Way:—Choose the Pír and regard him as the essence of the Way. The Pír is (like) summer, and (other) people are (like) the autumn month; (other) people are like night, and the Pír is the moon.",9
"I have bestowed on (my) young Fortune (Husámu’ddín) the name of Pír (old), because he is (made) old by the Truth, not (made) old by Time. So old is he that he hath no beginning: there is no rival to such a unique Pearl. Verily, old wine grows more potent; verily, old gold is more highly prized. Choose a Pír, for without a Pír this journey is exceeding full of woe and affright and danger. Without an escort you are bewildered (even) on a road you have travelled many times (before):",9
"Do not, then, travel alone on a Way that you have not seen at all, do not turn your head away from the Guide. Fool, if his shadow (protection) be not over you, then the cry of the ghoul will keep you (wandering about) with your head in a whirl. The ghoul will (entice you) from the Way (and) cast you into destruction: there have been in this Way many craftier than you (who have perished miserably). Hear (learn) from the Qur’án the perdition of the wayfarers, what the evil-souled Iblís did unto them: He carried them far—a journey of hundreds of thousands of years—from the Highway, and made them backsliders and naked (devoid of good works).",9
"Behold their bones and their hair! Take warning, and drive not your ass towards them! Seize the neck of your ass (the flesh) and lead him towards the Way, towards the good keepers and knowers of the Way. Beware! do not let your ass go, and do not remove your hand from him, because his love is for the place where green herbs are plentiful. If you carelessly leave him free for one moment, he will go (many) leagues in the direction of the herbage. The ass is an enemy to the Way, (he is) madly in love with fodder: oh, many is the attendant on him that he has brought to ruin!",9
"If you know not the Way, whatsoever the ass desires, do the contrary thereof: that, surely, will be the right Way. (The Prophet said), “Consult them (women), and then oppose (them in what they advise): he that disobeys them not will be ruined.” Be not a friend to (sensual) passion and desire, since it leads you astray from the Way of God. Nothing in the world will break (mortify) this passion like the shadow (protection) of fellow-travellers. How the Prophet, on whom be peace, enjoined ‘Alí—may God make his person honoured—saying, “When every one seeks to draw nigh to God by means of some kind of devotional act, do thou seek the favour of God by associating with His wiseand chosen servant, that thou mayst be the first of all to arrive (to gain access to Him).” The Prophet said to ‘Alí, “O ‘Alí, thou art the Lion of God, thou art a courageous knight,",9
"But do not even rely upon thy lion-heartedness: come into the shade of the palm tree of hope. Come into the shade (protection) of the Sage whom no conveyer can carry off from the Way. His shadow on the earth is like Mount Qáf, his spirit is (like) the Símurgh that circles (soars) exceedingly high. If I should tell of his qualities until the Resurrection, do not seek (expect) any conclusion and end to them. The (Divine) Sun has veiled Himself in Man: apprehend (this mystery), and God knows best what is right.",9
"O ‘Alí, above all devotional acts in the Way (of God) do thou choose the shadow (protection) of the servant of God. Every one took refuge in some act of devotion and discovered for themselves some means of deliverance. Go thou, take refuge in the shadow of the Sage, that thou mayst escape from the Enemy that opposes (thee) in secret. Of all acts of devotion this is the best for thee: (thereby) thou wilt gain precedence over every one that has outstripped (the rest).” When the Pír has accepted thee, take heed, surrender thyself (to him): go, like Moses, under the authority of Khizr.",9
"Bear patiently whatever is done by a Khizr who is without hypocrisy, in order that Khizr may not say, “Begone, thisis (our) parting.” Though he stave in the boat, do not speak a word; though he kill a child, do not tear thy hair. God has declared that his (the Pír's) hand is as His own, since He gave out (the words) the Hand of God is above their hands. The Hand of God causes him (the child) to die and (then) brings him to life. What of life? He makes him a spirit everlasting.If any one, by rare exception, traversed this Way alone (without a Pír), he arrived (at his goal) through the help (and favour) of the hearts of the Pírs.",9
"The hand of the Pír is not withdrawn from the absent (those who are not under his authority): his hand is naught but the grasp of God. Inasmuch as they give such a robe of honour to the absent, (what must they give their disciples?): undoubtedly the present are better than the absent. Since they are bestowing (spiritual) food on the absent, see what bounties they must lay before one who is present. Where is one that girds himself (for service) before them to (i.e. how far superior is he to) one that is outside the door? When thou hast chosen thy Pír, be not faint-hearted, be not weak as water and crumbly as earth.",9
"If thou art enraged by every blow, then how wilt thou become a (clear) mirror without being polished? How the man of Qazwín was tattooing the figure of a lion in blue on his shoulders, and (then) repenting because of the (pain of the) needle-pricks. Hear from the narrator this story about the way and custom of the people of Qazwín. They tattoo themselves in blue with the point of a needle on body and hand and shoulders, so as to suffer no injury. A certain man of Qazwín went to a barber and said, “Tattoo me (and) do it charmingly (artistically).” “O valiant sir,” said he, “what figure shall I tattoo?” He answered, “Prick in the figure of a furious lion.",9
"Leo is my ascendant: tattoo the form of a lion. Exert yourself, prick in plenty of the blue dye.” “On what place,” he asked, “shall I tattoo you?” Said he, “Prick the design of the beauty on my shoulder-blade.” As soon as he began to stick in the needle, the pain of it settled in the shoulder, And the hero fell a-moaning—“O illustrious one, you have killed me: what figure are you tattooing?” “Why,” said he, “you bade me do a lion.” “What limb (of the lion),” asked the other, “did you begin with?”",10
"“I have begun at the tail,” said he. “O my dear friend,” he cried, “leave out the tail! My breath is stopped by the lion's tail and rump: his rump has tightly closed (choked) my windpipe. Let the lion be without a tail, O lion-maker, for my heart is faint from the blows of the prong (the tattooer's needle).” That person commenced to prick in (the blue) on another part (of the man's shoulder) without fear, without favour, without mercy. He yelled—“Which of his members is this?” “This is his ear, my good man,” the barber replied.",10
"“O Doctor,” said he, “let him have no ears: omit the ears and cut the frock short.” The barber began to insert (his needle) in another part: once more the man of Qazwín set out to wail, Saying, “What is the member (you are pricking in) now on this third spot?” He replied, “This is the lion's belly, my dear sir.” “Let the lion have no belly,” said he: “what need of a belly for the picture that is (already) sated?” The barber became distraught and remained in great bewilderment: he stood for a long time with his fingers in his teeth;",10
"Then the master flung the needle to the ground and said, “Has this happened to any one in the world? Who (ever) saw a lion without tail and head and belly? God himself did not create a lion like this.” O brother, endure the pain of the lancet, that you may escape from the poison of your miscreant self (nafs), For sky and sun and moon bow in worship to the people who have escaped from self existence. Any one in whose body the miscreant self has died, sun and cloud obey his command.",10
"Since his heart has learned to light the candle (of spiritual knowledge and love), the sun cannot burn him. God hath made mention of the rising sun as turning aside— like that—from their cave. The thorn becomes entirely beautiful, like the rose, in the sight of the particular that is going towards the Universal. What is (the meaning of) to exalt and glorify God? To deem yourself despicable and (worthless) as dust. What is (the meaning of) to learn the knowledge of God's unity? To consume yourself in the presence of the One.",10
"If you wish to shine like day, burn up your night-like self-existence. Melt away your existence, as copper (melts away) in the elixir, in the being of Him who fosters (and sustains) existence. You have fastened both your hands tight on (are determined not to give up) “I” and “we”: all this (spiritual) ruin is caused by dualism. How the wolf and fox went to hunt in attendance on the lion. A lion, wolf, and fox had gone to hunt in the mountains in quest (of food), That by supporting each other they might tie fast the bonds and fetters (of captivity) on the hunted animals,",10
"And all three together might seize much and great quarry in that deep wilderness. Although the fierce lion was ashamed of them (the wolf and fox), yet he did them honour and gave them his company on the way. To a king like this the (escort of) soldiers are an annoyance, but he accompanied them: a united party is a mercy (from God). A moon like this is disgraced by the stars: it is amongst the stars for generosity's sake. The (Divine) command, Consult them, came to the Prophet, though no counsel is to be compared with his own.",10
"In the scales barley has become the companion of gold, (but that is) not because barley has become a substance like gold. The spirit has now become the body's fellow-traveller: the dog has become for a time the guardian of the palace-gate. When this party (the wolf and fox) went to the mountains at the stirrup (side) of the lion majestic and grand, They found a mountain-ox and goat and fat hare, and their business went forward (prosperously). Whoever is on the heels of him that is a lion in combat, roast-meat does not fail him by day or by night.",10
"When they brought them (the animals which they had caught) from the mountains to the jungle, killed and wounded and dragging along in (streams of) blood, The wolf and fox hoped that a division (of the prey) would be made according to the justice of emperors. The reflexion of the hope of both of them struck the lion: the lion knew (what was) the ground for those hopes. Any one that is the lion and prince of (spiritual) mysteries, he will know all that the conscience thinks. Beware! Guard thyself, O heart disposed to thinking, from any evil thought in his presence.",10
"He knows and keeps riding on silently: he smiles in thy face in order to mask (his feelings). When the lion perceived their bad ideas, he did not declare (his knowledge), and paid (courteous) regard (to them) at the time, But he said to himself, “I will show you what (chastisement) ye deserve, O beggarly villains! Was my judgement not enough for you? Is this your opinion of my bounty, O ye whose understanding and judgement are (derived) from my judgement and from my world-adorning gifts?",10
"What else (but good) should the picture think of the painter, since he bestowed thought and knowledge upon it? Had ye such a vile opinion of me, O ye who are a scandal to the world? I will strike off the hypocritical heads of them that think ill of God. I will deliver the Sphere (of Time) from your disgrace, so that this tale shall remain in the world (as a warning).” While thus meditating, the lion continued to smile visibly: do not trust the smiles of the lion!",10
"Worldly wealth is (like) the smiles of God: it has made us drunken and vainglorious and threadbare (deprived of the means of salvation). Poverty and distress are better for thee, O lord, for (then) that smile will remove its lure. How the lion made trial of the wolf and said, “Come forward, O wolf, and divide the prey amongst us.” The lion said, “O wolf, divide this (prey): O old wolf, make justice new (give it new life by thy example). Be my deputy in the office of distributor, that it may be seen of what substance thou art.” “O King,” said he, “the wild ox is thy share: he is big, and thou art big and strong and active.",10
"The goat is mine, for the goat is middle and intermediate; do thou, O fox, receive the hare, and no mistake!” The lion said, “O wolf, how hast thou spoken? Say! When I am here, dost thou speak of ‘I’ and ‘thou’? Truly, what a cur the wolf must be, that he regarded himself in the presence of a lion like me who am peerless and unrivalled!” (Then) he said, “Come forward, O thou self-esteeming ass!” He approached him, the lion seized him with his claws and rent him. Inasmuch as he (the lion) did not see in him the kernel of right conduct, he tore the skin off his head as a punishment.",10
"He said, “Since the sight of me did not transport thee out of thyself, a spirit like this (thine) must needs die miserably. Since thou wert not passing away (from thyself) in my presence, ’twas an act of grace to smite thy neck (behead thee).” Everything is perishing except His face: unless thou art in His face (essence), do not seek to exist. When any one has passed away (from himself) in my face (essence), (the words) everything is perishing are not applicable (to him), Because he is in except, he has transcended not (nonentity): whosoever is in except has not passed away (perished).",10
"Whosoever is uttering ‘I’ and ‘we’ at the door (of the Divine Court), he is turned back from the door and is continuing in not (nonentity). The story of the person who knocked at a friend's door: his friend from within asked who he was: he said, “’Tis I,” and the friend answered, “Since thou art thou, I will not open the door: I know not any friend that is ‘I.’” A certain man came and knocked at a friend's door: his friend asked him, “Who art thou, O trusty one?” He answered, “I.” The friend said, “Begone, ’tis not the time (for thee to come in): at a table like this there is no place for the raw.” Save the fire of absence and separation, who (what) will cook the raw one? Who (what) will deliver him from hypocrisy? The wretched man went away, and for a year in travel (and) in separation from his friend he was burned with sparks of fire.",10
"That burned one was cooked: then he returned and again paced to and fro beside the house of his comrade. He knocked at the door with a hundred fears and respects, lest any disrespectful word might escape from his lips. His friend called to him, “Who is at the door?” He answered, “’Tis thou art at the door, O charmer of hearts.” “Now,” said the friend, “since thou art I, come in, O myself: there is not room in the house for two I's. The double end of thread is not for the needle: inasmuch as thou art single, come into this needle.”",10
"’Tis the thread that is connected with the needle: the eye of the needle is not suitable for the camel. How should the existence (body) of the camel be fined down save by the shears of ascetic exercises and works? For that, O reader, the hand (power) of God is necessary, for it is the Be, and it was (bringer into existence) of every (seemingly) impossible thing. By His hand every impossible thing is made possible; by fear of Him every unruly one is made quiet. What of the man blind from birth and the leper? Even the dead is made living by the spell of the Almighty,",10
"And that non-existence which is more dead than the dead— non-existence is compelled (to obey) when He calls it into being. Recite (the text), Every day He is (engaged) in some affair: do not deem Him idle and inactive. His least act, every day, is that He despatches three armies: One army from the loins (of the fathers) towards the mothers, in order that the plant may grow in the womb; One army from the wombs to the Earth, that the world may be filled with male and female;",10
"One army from the Earth (to what is) beyond death, that every one may behold the beauty of (good) works. This discourse hath no end. Come, hasten (back) to those two sincere and devoted friends. Description of Unification. His friend said to him, “Come in, O thou who art entirely myself, not different like the rose and thorn in the garden.” The thread has become single. Do not now fall into error if thou seest that the letters K and N are two.’ K and N are pulling like a noose, that they may draw non-existence into great affairs.",10
"Hence the noose must be double in (the world of) forms, though those two (letters) are single in effect. Whether the feet be two or four, they traverse one road, like the double shears (which) makes (but) one cut. Look at those two fellow-washermen: there is apparently a difference between that one and this: The one has thrown the cotton garments into the water, while the other partner is drying them. Again the former makes the dry clothes wet: ’tis as though he were spitefully thwarting his opposite;",10
"Yet these two opposites, who seem to be at strife, are of one mind and acting together in agreement. Every prophet and every saint hath a way (of religious doctrine and practice), but it leads to God: all (the ways) are (really) one. When slumber (heedlessness) overtook the concentration (attention) of the listener, the water carried the millstones away. The course of this water is above the mill: its going into the mill is for your sakes. Since ye had no further need of the mill, he (the prophet or saint) made the water flow back into the original stream.",10
"The rational spirit (the Logos) is (coming) to the mouth for the purpose of teaching: else (it would not come, for) truly that speech hath a channel apart: It is moving without noise and without repetitions (of sound) to the rose-gardens beneath which are the rivers. O God, do Thou reveal to the soul that place where speech is growing without letters, That the pure soul may make of its head a foot (fly headlong) towards the far stretching expanse of non-existence— An expanse very ample and spacious; and from it this phantasy and being (of ours) is fed.",10
"(The realm of) phantasies is narrower than non-existence (potential existence): on that account phantasy is the cause of pain. (The realm of actual) existence, again, was (ever) narrower than (the realm of) phantasy: hence in it moons become like the moon that has waned. Again, the existence of the world of sense and colour is narrower (than this), for ’tis a narrow prison. The cause of narrowness is composition (compoundness) and number (plurality): the senses are moving towards composition. Know that the world of Unification lies beyond sense: if you want Unity, march in that direction.",10
"The (Divine) Command KuN (Be) was a single act, and the (two letters) N and K occurred (only) in speech, while the (inward) meaning was pure (uncompounded). This discourse hath no end. Return, that (we may see) what happened to the wolf in combat (with the lion). How the lion punished the wolf who had shown disrespect in dividing (the prey). That haughty one tore off the head of the wolf, in order that two-headedness (dualism) and distinction might not remain (in being). ’Tis (the meaning of) So we took vengeance on them, O old wolf, inasmuch as thou wert not dead in the presence of the Amír. After that, the lion turned to the fox and said, “Divide it (the prey) for breakfast.”",10
"He bowed low and said, “This fat ox will be thy food at breakfast, O excellent King, And this goat will be a portion reserved for the victorious King at midday, And the hare too for supper—(to be) the repast at nightfall of the gracious and bountiful King.” Said the lion, “O fox, thou hast made justice shine forth: from whom didst thou learn to divide in such a manner? Whence didst thou learn this, O eminent one?” “O King of the world,” he replied, “(I learned it) from the fate of the wolf.”",10
"The lion said, “Inasmuch as thou hast become pledged to love of me, pick up all the three (animals), and take (them) and depart. O fox, since thou hast become entirely mine, how should I hurt thee when thou hast become myself? I am thine, and all the beasts of chase are thine: set thy foot on the Seventh Heaven and mount (beyond)! Since thou hast taken warning from (the fate of) the vile wolf, thou art not a fox: thou art my own lion. The wise man is he that in (the hour of) the shunned tribulation takes warning from the death of his friends.”",10
"The fox said (to himself), “A hundred thanks to the lion for having called me up after that wolf. If he had bidden me first, saying, ‘Do thou divide this,’ who would have escaped from him with his life?” Thanks be to Him (God), then, that He caused us to appear (be born) in the world after those of old, So that we heard of the chastisements which God inflicted upon the past generations in the preceding time, That we, like the fox, may keep better watch over ourselves from (considering) the fate of those ancient wolves.",10
"On this account he that is God's prophet and veracious in explanation called us “a people on which God has taken mercy.” Behold with clear vision the bones and fur of those wolves, and take warning, O mighty ones! The wise man will put off from his head (lay aside) this self-existence and wind (of vanity), since he heard (what was) the end of the Pharaohs and ‘Ád; And if he do not put it off, others will take warning from what befell him in consequence of his being misguided. How Noah, on whom be peace, threatened his people, saying, “Do not struggle with me, for I am (only) a veil: ye are really struggling with God (who is) within this (veil), O God-forsaken men!” Noah said, “O ye headstrong ones, I am not I: I am dead to the (animal) soul, I am living through the Soul of souls.",10
"Inasmuch as I am dead to the senses of the father of mankind (human sense perceptions), God has become my hearing and perception and sight. Since I am not I, this breath (of mine) is from Him: in the presence of this breath if any one breathes (a word) he is an infidel.” In the form of this fox there is the lion: ’tis not fitting to advance boldly towards this fox. Unless thou believe in him from his exterior aspect (accept him in the form in which he appears), thou wilt not hear from him the lions' roar. If Noah had not been the Eternal Lion, why should he have cast a whole world into confusion?",10
"He was hundreds of thousands of lions in a single body; he was like fire, and the world (like) a stack. Forasmuch as the stack neglected (to pay) the tithe due to him, he launched such a flame against that stack. Whosoever in the presence of this hidden Lion opens his mouth disrespectfully, like the wolf, That Lion will tear him to pieces, as (he tore) the wolf, and will recite to him (the text) So we took vengeance upon them. He will suffer blows, like the wolf, from the Lion's paw: foolish is he that waxed bold in the presence of the Lion.",10
"Would that those blows fell upon the body, so that it might be that (the sinner's) faith and heart would be safe! My power is broken (fails me) on reaching this point: how can I declare this mystery? Make little of your bellies, like that fox: do not play fox's tricks in His presence. Lay the whole of your “we” and “I” before Him: the kingdom is His kingdom: give the kingdom to Him. When ye become poor (selfless) in the right Way, verily the Lion and the Lion's prey are yours,",10
"Because He is holy, and Glory is His attribute: He hath no need of good things and kernel or rind. Every prize and every gift of grace that exists is for the sake of the servants of that King (God). The King hath no desire (for anything): He hath made all this empire for His creatures. Happy is he that knew! Of what use should the possession of empires be to Him who created (all) empire and the two worlds? In the presence of His Glory keep close watch over your hearts, lest ye be put to shame by thinking evil.",10
"For He sees conscience and thought and quest (desire) as (plainly) as a thread of hair in pure milk. He whose clear breast has become devoid of (any) image (impression) has become a mirror for the impressions of the Invisible. He becomes intuitively and undoubtingly aware of our inmost thought, because the true believer is the mirror of the true believer. When he rubs our (spiritual) poverty on the touchstone, then he knows the difference between faith and doubt. When his soul becomes the touchstone of the coin, then he will see (distinguish) the (true) heart and the false money (of hypocrisy). How kings seat in front of them the Súfís who know God, in order that their eyes may be illumined by (seeing) them.",10
"Such is the custom of kings: you will have heard of this, if you remember. The paladins stand on their left hand, because the heart (the seat of courage) is fixed on the left side (of the body). On the right hand are the chancellor and the secretaries, because the science of writing and book-keeping belongs (in practice) to this hand. They give the Súfís the place in front of their countenance, for they (the Súfís) are a mirror for the soul, and better than a mirror, (Since) they have polished their breasts (hearts) in commemoration (of God) and meditation, that the heart's mirror may receive the virgin (original) image.",10
"Whoever is born beautiful from the loins of Creation, a mirror must be placed before him. The beauteous face is in love with the mirror: it (such a face) is a polisher of the soul and (a kindler) of the fear of God in (men's) hearts. How the guest came to Joseph, on whom be peace, and how Joseph demanded of him a gift and present on his return fromabroad. The loving friend came from the ends of the earth and became the guest of Joseph the truthful, For they had been well acquainted in childhood, reclining (together) on the sofa of acquaintance. He spoke to him (Joseph) of the injustice and envy of his brethren: Joseph said, “That was (like) a chain, and I was the lion.",10
"The lion is not disgraced by the chain: I do not complain of God's destiny. If the lion had a chain on his neck, (yet) he was prince over all the chain-makers.” He asked, “How wert thou in regard to the prison and the well?” “Like the moon,” said Joseph, “in the interlunar period (when she is) on the wane.” If in that period the new moon is bent double, does not she at last become the full moon in the sky? Though the seed-pearl is pounded in the mortar, it becomes the light of eye and heart and looks aloft.",11
"They cast a grain of wheat under earth, then from its earth they raised up ears of corn; Once more they crushed it with the mill: its value increased and it became soul invigorating bread; Again they crushed the bread under their teeth: it became the mind and spirit and understanding of one endowed with reason; Again, when that spirit became lost in Love, it became (as that which) rejoiceth the sowers after the sowing. This discourse hath no end. Come back, that we may see what that good man said to Joseph.",11
"After he (Joseph) had told him his story, he (Joseph) said, “Now, O so-and-so, what traveller's gift hast thou brought for me?” To come empty-handed to the door of friends is like going without wheat to the mill. God, exalted is He, will say to the people at the gathering (for Judgement), “Where is your present for the Day of Resurrection? Ye have come to Us and alone without provision, just in the same guise as We created you. Hark, what have ye brought as an offering—a gift on homecoming for the Day when ye rise from the dead?",11
"Or had ye no hope of returning? Did the promise of (meeting Me) to-day seem vain to you?” Dost thou (O reader) disbelieve in the promise of being His guest? Then from the kitchen (of His bounty) thou wilt get (only) dust and ashes. And if thou art not disbelieving, how with such empty hands art thou setting foot in the Court of that Friend? Refrain thyself a little from sleep and food: bring the gift for thy meeting with Him. Become scant of sleep (like them that) were slumbering (but a small part of the night); in the hours of dawn be of (those who)were asking pardon of God.",11
"Stir a little, like the embryo, in order that thou mayst be given the senses which behold the Light, And (then) thou art outside of this womb-like world: thou goest from the earth into a wide expanse. Know that the saying, “God's earth is wide,” refers to that ample region into which the saints have entered. The heart is not oppressed by that spacious expanse: there the fresh boughs of the palm-tree do not become dry. At present thou art bearing (the burden of) thy senses: thou art becoming weary and exhausted and (ready to fall) headlong.",11
"Since, at the time of sleep, thou art borne (on high), and art not bearing (the burden), thy fatigue is gone and thou art free from pain and anguish. Regard the time of sleep as a (mere) taste (sample) in comparison with the state in which the saints are borne (on high). The saints are (like) the Men of the Cave, O obstinate one: they are asleep (even) in rising up and turning to and fro. He (God) is drawing them, without their taking trouble to act, without consciousness (on their part), to the right hand and to the left. What is that right hand? Good deeds. What is that left hand? The affairs of the body.",11
"These two (kinds of) actions proceed from the saints, (while) they are unconscious of them both, like the echo: If the echo causes thee to hear good and evil, the mountain itself is unconscious of either. How the guest said to Joseph, “I have brought thee the gift of a mirror, so that whenever thou lookest in it thou wilt seethine own fair face and remember me.” Joseph said, “Come, produce the gift.” He (the guest), on account of shame (confusion) at this demand, sobbed aloud. “How many a gift,” said he, “did I seek for thee! No (worthy) gift came into my sight. How should I bring a grain (of gold) to the mine? How should I bring a drop (of water) to the (Sea of) ‘Umán?",11
"I shall (only) bring cumin to Kirmán, if I bring my heart and soul (as a gift) to thee. There is no seed that is not in this barn, except thy beauty which hath no equal. I deemed it fitting that I should bring to thee a mirror like the (inward) light of a (pure) breast, That thou mayst behold thy beauteous face therein, O thou who, like the sun, art the candle of heaven. I have brought thee a mirror, O light (of mine eyes), so that when thou seest thy face thou mayst think of me.”",11
"He drew forth the mirror from beneath his arm: the fair one's business is with a mirror. What is the mirror of Being? Not-being. Bring not-being (as your gift), if you are not a fool. Being can be seen (only) in not-being: the rich bestow (exhibit) generosity on the poor. The clear mirror of bread is truly the hungry man; tinder, likewise, is the mirror of that (the stick or flint) from which fire is struck. Not-being and defect, wherever they arise (appear), are the mirror which displays the excellence of all crafts.",11
"When a garment is neat and well-stitched, how should it enable the tailor to exhibit his skill? Trunks of trees must be unhewn in order that the woodcutter may fashion the stem or the branches (and thus exercise his craft). The doctor who sets broken bones goes to the place where the person with the fractured leg is. How shall the excellence of the art of medicine be made manifest when there is no emaciated invalid? How shall the (power of the) Elixir be shown if the vileness and baseness of coppers is not notorious?",11
"Defects are the mirror of the quality of perfection, and that vileness is the mirror of power and glory, Because (every) contrary is certainly made evident by its contrary; because honey is perceived (to be sweet by contrast) with vinegar. Whoever has seen and recognised his own deficiency has ridden post-haste (made rapid progress) in perfecting himself. The reason why he (any one) is not flying towards the Lord of glory is that he supposes himself to be perfect. There is no worse malady in your soul, O haughty one, than the conceit of perfection.",11
"Much blood must flow from your heart and eye, that self-complacency may go out of you. The fault of Iblís lay in thinking “I am better (than Adam),” and this disease is in the soul of every (human) creature. Though he regard himself as very broken (in spirit), know that it is (a case of) clear water (on the surface) and dung under the stream. When he (the Devil) stirs you in trial, immediately the water becomes dung-coloured. There is dung in the bed of the stream, my man, though to you the stream appears pure.",11
"’Tis the Pír full of wisdom, well-acquainted with the Way, that digs a channel for (draining off) the streams of the flesh and the body. Can the water of the (polluted) stream clear out the dung? Can man's knowledge sweep away the ignorance of his sensual self? How shall the sword fashion its own hilt? Go, entrust (the cure of) this wound to a surgeon. Flies gather on every wound, so that no one sees the foulness of his wound. Those flies are your (evil) thoughts and your (love of) possessions: your wound is the darkness of your (spiritual) states;",11
"And if the Pír lays a plaster on your wound, at once the pain and lamentation are stilled, So that you fancy it (the wound) is healed, (whereas in reality) the (healing) ray of the plaster has shone upon the (wounded) spot. Beware! Do not (scornfully) turn your head away from the plaster, O you who are wounded in the back, but recognise that that (healing of the wound) proceeds from the ray: do not regard it as (proceeding) from your own constitution. How the writer of the (Qur’ánic) Revelation fell into apostasy because (when) the ray of the Revelation shot upon him, herecited the (revealed) verse before the Prophet, on whom be peace, (had dictated it to him); then he said, “So I too am oneupon whom Revelation has descended.” Before (the time of) ‘Uthmán there was a scribe who used to be diligent in writing down the Revelation. Whenever the Prophet dictated the Revelation, he would write out the same (portion) on the leaf.",11
"The beams of that Revelation would shine upon him, and he would find Wisdom within him. The substance of that Wisdom was dictated by the Prophet: by this (small) amount (of reflected Wisdom) that meddling fool was led astray, Thinking, “I have in my conscience the Truth of that which the illumined Prophet is saying.” The ray of his thought struck the Prophet: the wrath of God descended on his (the scribe's) soul. He abandoned both his work as a scribe and the Religion (Islam): he became the malignant foe of Mustafá (Mohammed) and the Religion.",12
"Mustafá said, “O obstinate miscreant, if the Light was from thee, how shouldst thou have become black (with sin)? If thou hadst been the Divine fountain (whence the Revelation issued), thou wouldst not have let out such black water as this.” Lest his reputation should be ruined in the sight of all and sundry, this (pride) kept his mouth shut. His (a sinner's) heart is being darkened, hence he is unable to repent: this is wonderful. He (the scribe) was crying “Alas,” but “Alas” was of no use to him when the sword came on and took off his head.",12
"God has made reputation (to be like) a hundred maunds' weight of iron: oh, many a one is bound in the unseen chain! Pride and infidelity have barred that Way (of repentance) in such wise that he (the sinner) cannot utter a sigh. He (God) said, “(We have put on their necks) shackles (chin-high), and thereby they are forced to lift up their heads”: those shackles are not (put) on us from outside. “(And We have put) behind them a barrier, and We have made a covering (of darkness) over them”: the uncle (old sinner) is not seeing the barrier in front (of him) and behind. The barrier that arose has the appearance of open country: he does not know that it is the barrier of the Divine destiny.",12
"Your (earthly) beloved is a barrier to the face of the (Divine) Beloved: your (worldly) guide is a barrier to the words of the (true spiritual) guide. Oh, many are the infidels that have a passionate longing for the Religion (Islam): his (such a one's) chain (stumbling-block) is reputation and pride and that and this (object of desire). The chain is hidden. but ’tis worse than iron: the iron chain is cloven by the axe. The iron chain can be removed: none knows how to cure the invisible chain. If a man is stung by a wasp, he extracts the wasp's sting from his body,",12
"But since the stinging wound is from (inflicted by) your self-existence, the pain continues with violence and the anguish is not relieved. The (full) explanation of this (matter) is springing forth (seeking to escape) from my breast, but I am afraid it may give (you cause to) despair.Nay, do not despair: make yourself cheerful, call for help to Him who comes at the call, Saying, “Forgive us, O Thou who lovest to forgive, O Thou who hast a medicine for the old gangrenous disease!” The reflexion of Wisdom led astray that miserable one (the Prophet's scribe): be not self-conceited, lest it (your self-conceit) raise up the dust from you (utterly destroy you).",12
"O brother, Wisdom is flowing in upon you: it comes from the Abdál, and in you it is (only) a borrowed thing. Although the house (your heart) has found a light within it, that (light) has shone forth from a light-giving neighbour. Render thanks, be not beguiled by vanity, do not turn up your nose (in disdain), hearken attentively, and do not show any self- conceit. ’Tis a hundred pities and griefs that this borrowed (unreal) state (of self-assertion) has put the religious communities far from religious communion. I am the (devoted) slave of him who does not regard himself in every caravanseray (at every stage in his spiritual progress) as having attained to (the privilege of sitting at) the table (of union with God).",12
"Many is the caravanseray that must be quitted, in order that one day the man may reach home. Though the iron has become red, it is not red (by nature): it (the redness) is a ray borrowed from something that strikes fire. If the window or the house is full of light, do not deem aught luminous except the sun. Every door and wall says, “I am luminous: I do not hold the rays of another, I (myself) am this (light).” Then the sun says, “O thou who art not right (in thy belief), when I set ’twill become evident (thou wilt see what the truth is).”",12
"The plants say, “We are green of ourselves, we are gay and smiling (blooming) and we are tall (by nature).” The season of summer says (to them), “O peoples, behold yourselves when I depart!” The body is boasting of its beauty and comeliness, (while) the spirit, having concealed its glory and pinions and plumes, Says to it, “O dunghill, who art thou? Through my beams thou hast come to life for a day or two. Thy coquetry and prideful airs are not contained in the world (go beyond all bounds), (but) wait till I spring up (and escape) from thee!",12
"They whose love warmed thee will dig a grave for thee, they will make thee a morsel for ants and reptiles. That one who many a time in thy presence was dying (with desire for thee) will hold his nose at thy stench.” The beams of the spirit are speech and eye and ear: the beam (effect) of fire is the bubbling in the water. As the beam of the spirit falls on the body, so fall the beams of the Abdál on my soul. When the Soul of the soul withdraws from the soul, the soul becomes even as the soulless (lifeless) body. Know (this for sure)!",12
"For that reason I am laying my head (humbly) on the earth, so that she (the earth) may be my witness on the Day of Judgement. On the Day of Judgement, when she shall be made to quake mightily, this earth will bear witness to all that passed (in and from us); For she will plainly declare what she knows: earth and rocks will begin to speak. The philosopher, in his (vain) thought and opinion, becomes disbelieving: bid him go and dash his head against this wall! The speech of water, the speech of earth, and the speech of mud are apprehended by the senses of them that have hearts (the mystics).",12
"The philosopher who disbelieves in the moaning pillar is a stranger to the senses of the saints. He says that the beam (influence) of melancholia brings many phantasies into people's minds. Nay, but the reflexion of his wickedness and infidelity cast this idle fancy of scepticism upon him. The philosopher comes to deny the existence of the Devil, and at the same time he is possessed by a devil. If thou hast not seen the Devil, behold thyself: without diabolic possession there is no blueness in the forehead.",12
"Whosoever hath doubt and perplexity in his heart, he in this world is a secret philosopher. He is professing firm belief, but some time or other that philosophical vein will blacken his face (bring him to shame). Take care, O ye Faithful! for that (vein) is in you: in you is many an infinite world. In thee are all the two-and-seventy sects: woe (to thee) if one day they gain the upper hand over thee. From fear of this, every one who has the fortune (barg) of (holding) this Faith (Islam) is trembling like a leaf (barg).",12
"Thou hast laughed at Iblís and the devils because thou hast regarded thyself as a good man. When the soul shall turn its coat inside out (and be revealed as it really is), how many a “Woe is me” will it extort from the followers of the (Mohammedan) Religion! On the counter (of the shop) everything (every gilded coin) that looks like gold is smiling, because the touchstone is out of sight. O Coverer (of faults), do not lift up the veil from us, be a protector to us in our test (on the Day of Judgement). At night the false coin jostles (in rivalry) with the gold: the gold is waiting for day.",12
"With the tongue of its (inward) state the gold says, “Wait, O tinselled one, till day rises clear.” Hundreds of thousands of years the accursed Iblís was a saint and the prince of true believers; On account of the pride which he had, he grappled with Adam and was put to shame, like dung at morning tide. How Bal‘ am son of Bá‘úr prayed (to God), saying, “Cause Moses and his people to turn back, without having gained theirdesire, from this city which they have besieged.” To Bal‘am son of Bá‘úr the people of the world became subject, (for he was) like unto the Jesus of the time. They bowed (worshipfully) to none but him: his spell was (giving) health to the sick.",12
"From pride and (conceit of) perfection he grappled with Moses: his plight became such as thou hast heard. Even so there have been in the world, manifest or hidden, a hundred thousand like Iblís and Bal‘am. God caused these twain to be notorious, that these twain might bear witness against the rest. These two thieves He hanged on a high gallows (to be a warning to all); else there were many (other) thieves in (the pale of) His vengeance. These twain He dragged by their forelocks to the city (for slaughter); (but) ’tis impossible to number (all) the victims of His wrath.",12
"You are a favourite (of God), but within your (due) bounds. (Fear) God, (fear) God, do not set foot beyond (those) bounds. If you combat with one who is a greater favourite than yourself, ’twill bring you down to the lowest depth of the seventh earth. For what purpose is the tale of ‘Ád and Thamúd? That you may know that the prophets have disdain (for the wicked). These signs—the (earth's) swallowing up (sinners), the hurling of stones (upon them), and the thunderbolts—were evidence of the might of the Rational Soul.Kill all animals for the sake of man, kill all mankind for the sake of Reason.",12
"What is Reason? The Universal Intelligence of the man (prophet or saint) endowed with reason. Partial reason is reason (too), but it is infirm. All the animals that are wild (unfriendly) to man are inferior to the human animal. Their blood is free to mankind, since they have not become capable of human actions. The honour of the wild animals is fallen (has come to be of no account) because they have grown hostile to man. What honour, then, will be thine, O marvel (of folly), since thou hast become (like) timorous wild asses?",12
"Because of his usefulness, the (domesticated) ass ought not to be killed; (but) when he turns wild, his blood becomes lawful. Although the ass had no knowledge to restrain him (from becoming wild), the Loving One is not excusing him at all. How, then, shall man be excused, O noble friend, when he has become wild (refractory and hostile) to that Word (the voice of Reason)? Of necessity permission was given to shed the blood of the infidels, like (that of) a wild beast before the arrows and lances. All their wives and children are free spoil, because they are wildly averse to the august Reason.",12
"Once more, a reason that flees from the Reason of reason (Universal Reason) is transported from rationality to (the grade of) the animals. How Hárút and Márút relied upon their immaculateness and desired to mix with the people of this world and fell into temptation. As (for example), because of their arrogance, the celebrated Hárút and Márút were smitten by the poisoned arrow (of Divine wrath). They had confidence in their holiness, (but) what (use) is it for the buffalo to have confidence in the lion? Though he make a hundred shifts (to defend himself) with his horn, the fierce lion will tear him to pieces limb by limb. (Even) if he become as full of horns (prickles) as a hedgehog, the buffalo will inevitably be killed by the lion.",12
"(But) though the Sarsar wind uproots many trees, it makes every blade of grass glisten with beauty. That violent wind had pity on the weakness of the grass: do not thou, O heart, brag vainly of thy strength. How should the axe be afraid of the thickness of the branches? It cuts them to picces. But it does not beat itself against a leaf, it does not beat its edge except against an edge (something hard and solid like itself). What does the flame care for the great quantity of firewood? How should the butcher flee in terror from the multitude of sheep?",12
"What is form in the presence of (in comparison with) reality? Very feeble. ’Tis the reality of the sky that keeps it upside down (like an inverted cup). Judge by the analogy of the celestial wheel: from whom does its motion proceed? From directive Reason. The motion of this shield-like body is (derived) from the veiled spirit, O son. The motion of this wind is from its reality, like the wheel that is captive to the water of the stream. The ebb and flow and incoming and outgoing of this breath —from whom does it proceed but from the spirit that is filled with desire?",12
"Now it (the spirit) makes it (the breath) jím, now há and dál; now it makes it peace, now strife. Even so our God had made this (Sarsar) wind like a (raging) dragon against ‘Ád. Again, He had also made that wind (to be) peace and regardfulness and safety for the true believers. “The Reality is Allah,” said the Shaykh of the (Mohammedan) Religion, (who is) the sea of the spiritual realities of the Lord of created beings. All the tiers of earth and heaven are (but) as straws in that flowing sea.",12
"The rushing and tossing of the straws in the water is produced by the water when it is agitated. When it (the sea of Reality) wishes to make them (the straws) cease from struggling, it casts the straws toward the shore. When it draws them from the shore into the surge it does with them that which the Sarsar (wind) does with the grass. This topic is endless. Speed back, O youth, to (the story of) Hárút and Márút. The rest of the story of Hárút and Márút, and how an exemplary punishment was inflicted on them, even in this world, inthe pit of Babylon. Inasmuch as the sin and wickedness of the people of the world was becoming clearly visible to them both from the latticed window (of Heaven),",12
"They began to gnaw their hands in wrath, but had no eyes for their own fault. The ugly man saw himself in the mirror: he turned his face away from that (spectacle) and was enraged. When the self-conceited person has seen any one commit a sin, there appears in him a fire (derived) from Hell. He calls that (hellish) pride defence of the Religion: he regards not the soul of arrogance in himself. Defence of the Religion has a different character, for from that (religious) fire a (whole) world is green (verdant and flourishing).",12
"God said to them, “If ye are enlightened, (nevertheless) look not (with scorn) upon the doers of black deeds who have been made forgetful (of God). Render thanks, O Host (of Heaven) and Servants (of God)! Ye are freed from lust and sexual intercourse. If I impose that kind of nature on you, Heaven will accept you no more. The preservation (from sin) which ye have in your bodies is from the reflexion of My preservation and care (of you). Oh, beware! Regard that as (coming) from Me, not from yourselves, lest the accursed Devil prevail against you.”",12
"As (for example) the writer of the Revelation given to the Prophet deemed the Wisdom and the Original Light (to be residing) in himself. He was reckoning himself a fellow-songster of the Birds of God, (whereas) that (which proceeded from him) was (only) a whistle resembling an echo. If you become an exponent (imitator) of the song of birds, how will you become acquainted with the (real) meaning of the bird? If you learn the note of a nightingale, how will you know what (feelings) it has towards a rose? Or if you do know, ’twill be from analogy and surmise, like the conjectures formed by deaf people from those who move their lips. How the deaf man went to visit his sick neighbour.",12
"One possessed of much wealth said to a deaf man, “A neighbour of thine is fallen ill.” The deaf man said to himself, “Being hard of hearing, what shall I understand of the words spoken by that youth?— Especially (as) he is ill and his voice is weak; but I must go thither, there's no escape. When I see his lips moving, I will form a conjecture as to that (movement) from myself. When I say, ‘How are you, O my suffering (friend)?’ he will reply, ‘I am fine’ or ‘I am pretty well.’",12
"I will say, ‘Thanks (to God)! What posset have you had to drink?’ He will reply, ‘Some sherbet’ or ‘a decoction of kidney-beans.’ (Then) I will say, ‘May you enjoy health! Who is the doctor attending you?’ He will answer, ‘So-and-so.’ ‘He is one who brings great luck with him,’ I will remark; ‘since he has come, things will go well for you. I have experienced (the luck of) his foot: wherever he goes, the desired object is attained.’” The good man made ready these conjectural answers, and went to see the invalid.",12
"“How are you?” he asked. “I am at the point of death,” said he. “Thanks (to God)!” cried the deaf man. At this, the patient became resentful and indignant, Saying (to himself), “What (cause for) thanksgiving is this? He has been my enemy.”—The deaf man made a conjecture, and (as now appears) it has turned out to be wrong. After that, he asked him what he had drunk. “Poison,” said he. “May it do you good and give you health!” said the deaf man. His (the invalid's) wrath increased. Then he inquired, “Which of the doctors is it that is coming to attend you?” He replied, “Azrael (the Angel of Death) is coming. Get you gone!” “His foot (arrival),” said the deaf man, “is very blessed: be glad!”",12
"The deaf man went forth. He said gaily, “Thanks (to God) for that! Now I will take leave.” The invalid said, “This is my mortal foe: I did not know he was (such) a mine of iniquity.” The mind of the invalid was seeking a hundred abusive terms, that he might send him a message (filled with abuse) of every description, As, when any one has eaten bad (indigestible) food, it is turning his heart (stomach) until he vomits. Suppression of anger is (like) this: do not vomit it, so that you may gain sweet words in recompense.",12
"Since he had no patience, he was tormented. “Where,” he cried, “is this cur, this infamous cuckold, That I may pour upon him what he said (make a retort in his own style)?—for at that time the lion of my thought was asleep (I was too weak to contend with him). Inasmuch as visiting the sick is for the purpose of (giving them) tranquillity, this is not a visit to the sick: it is the satisfaction of an enemy's wish. (His motive was) that he should see his enemy enfeebled and that his wicked heart should be at peace.” Many are they that do works of devotion and set their hearts on being approved and rewarded for the same.",12
"’Tis in truth a lurking sin: that which he (the pietist) thinks pure is (really) foul, As (in the case of) the deaf man, who fancied that he did a kindness, but it had the opposite result. He sits down well-pleased, saying, “I have paid my respects, I have performed what was due to my neighbour”; (But) he has (only) kindled a fire (of resentment) against himself in the invalid's heart and burned himself. Beware, then, of the fire that ye have kindled: verily ye have increased in sin.",12
"The Prophet said to our desert Arab, “Pray, for indeed thou hast not prayed (aright), my man.” As a means of preventing these dangers, “Guide us” comes in every (ritual) prayer, That is to say, “O God, do not mingle my prayer with the prayer of the erring and the hypocrites.” By the analogical reasoning which the deaf man adopted a ten years' friendship was made vain. Especially, O master, (you must avoid) the analogy drawn by the low senses in regard to the Revelation which is illimitable.",12
"If your sensuous ear is fit for (understanding) the letter (of the Revelation), know that your ear that receives the occult (meaning) is deaf. The first to bring analogical reasoning to bear against the Revealed Text was Iblís. The first person who produced these paltry analogies in the presence of the Lights of God was Iblís. He said, “Beyond doubt fire is superior to earth: I am of fire, and he (Adam) is of dingy earth. Let us, then, judge by comparing the secondary with its principal: he is of darkness, I of radiant light.” God said, “Nay, but on the contrary there shall be no relationships : asceticism and piety shall be the (sole) avenue to pre- eminence.”",12
"This is not the heritage of the fleeting world, so that thou shouldst gain it by ties of relationship: ’tis a spiritual (heritage). Nay, these things are the heritage of the prophets; the inheritors of these are the spirits of the devout. The son of Bú Jahl became a true believer for all to see; the son of Noah became one of those who lost the way. “The child of earth (Adam) became illumined like the moon; thou art the child of fire: get thee gone with thy face black (in disgrace)!” The wise man has made (use of) such reasonings and investigation on a cloudy day or at night for the sake of (finding) the qibla;",12
"But with the sun and with the Ka‘ba before your face, do not seek to reason and investigate in this manner. Do not pretend that you cannot see the Ka‘ba, do not avert your face from it because you have reasoned (that it is not to be seen). God knows best what is right. When you hear a pipe from the Bird of God, you commit its outward (meaning) to memory, like a lesson, And then from yourself (out of your own head) you make some analogies: you make (what is) mere fancy into a (thing of) substance (reality). The Abdál have certain mystical expressions of which the doctrines (of external religion) are ignorant.",12
"You have learned the birds' language by the sound (alone), you have kindled (invented) a hundred analogies and a hundred caprices. The hearts (of the saints) are wounded by you, as the invalid (was hurt by the deaf man), (while) the deaf man became intoxicated (overjoyed) with the vain notion of success. The writer of the Revelation, from (hearing) the Bird's voice, supposed that he was the Bird's equal: The Bird flapped a wing and blinded him: lo, it plunged him in the abyss of death and bale. “Beware! do not ye also, (beguiled) by a reflexion or an opinion, fall from the dignities of Heaven!",12
"Although ye are Hárút and Márút and superior to all (the angels) on the terrace of We are they that stand in ranks, (Yet) take mercy on the wickednesses of the wicked: do not cleave to egoism and selfconceit. Beware, lest (the Divine) jealousy come from ambush and ye fall headlong to the bottom of the earth.” They both said, “O God, Thine is the command: without Thy security (protection) where indeed is any security?” They were saying that, but their hearts were throbbing (with desire)—“How should evil come from us? Good servants (of God) are we!”",12
"The prick of desire in the two angels did not leave (them) until it sowed the seed of self-conceit. Then they were saying, “O ye that are composed of the (four) elements (and are) unacquainted with the purity of the spiritual beings, We will draw curtains (of light) over this (terrestrial) sky, we will come to earth and set up the canopy, We will deal justice and perform worship and every night we will fly up again to Heaven, That we may become the wonder of the world, that we may establish safety and security on the earth.”",12
"The analogy between the state of Heaven and (that of) the earth is inexact: it has a concealed difference. Explaining that one must keep one's own (spiritual) state and (mystical) intoxication hidden from the ignorant. Hearken to the words of the Sage (Hakím) who lived in seclusion, “Lay thy head in the same place where thou hast drunk the wine.” When the drunken man has gone astray from a tavern, he becomes the children's laughing-stock and plaything. Whatever way he goes, he is falling in the mud, (now) on this side and (now) on that side, and every fool is laughing at him. He (goes on) like this, while the children at his heels are without knowledge of his intoxication and the taste of his wine.",12
"All mankind are children except him that is intoxicated with God; none is grownup except him that is freed from sensual desire. He (God) said, “This world is a play and pastime, and ye are children”; and God speaks truth. If you have not gone forth from (taken leave of) play, you are a child: without purity of spirit how will you be fully intelligent (like an adult)? Know, O youth, that the lust in which men are indulging here (in this world) is like the sexual intercourse of children. What is the child's sexual intercourse? An idle play, compared with the sexual intercourse of a Rustam and a brave champion of Islam.",12
"The wars of mankind are like children's fights—all meaningless, pithless, and contemptible. All their fights are (fought) with wooden swords, all their purposes are (centred) in futility; They all are riding on a reed-cane (hobby-horse), saying, “This is our Buráq or mule that goes like Duldul.” They are (really) carrying (their hobby-horses), but in their folly they have raised themselves on high: they have fancied themselves to be riders carried along the road. Wait till the day when those who are borne aloft by God shall pass, galloping, beyond the nine tiers (of Heaven)!",12
"“The spirit and the angels shall ascend to Him”: at the ascension of the spirit Heaven shall tremble. Like children, ye all are riding on your skirts: ye have taken hold of the corner of your skirt (to serve) as a horse. From God came (the text), “Verily, opinion doth not enable (you) to dispense (with the Truth)”: when did the steed of opinion run (mount) to the Heavens? While preferring (in case of doubt) the stronger of the two (alternative) opinions, do not doubt whether you see the sun when it is shining! At that time (when the spirit returns to God) behold your steeds! Ye have made a steed of your own foot.",12
"Come, recognise that your imagination and reflection and sense-perception and apprehension are like the reed-cane on which children ride. The sciences of the mystics bear them (aloft); the sciences of sensual men are burdens to them. When knowledge strikes on the heart (is acquired through mystical experience), it becomes a helper (yárí); when knowledge strikes on the body (is acquired through the senses), it becomes a burden (bárí). God hath said, “(Like an ass) laden with his books”: burdensome is the knowledge that is not from Himself. The knowledge that is not immediately from Himself does not endure, (it is) like the tire woman's paint.",12
"But when you carry this burden well, the burden will be removed and you will be given (spiritual) joy. Beware! Do not carry this burden of knowledge for the sake of selfish desire (but mortify yourself), so that you may ride on the smooth-paced steed of knowledge, So that you may mount the smooth-paced steed of knowledge, (and that) afterwards the burden may fall from your shoulder. How wilt thou be freed from selfish desires without the cup of Hú (Him), O thou who hast become content with no more of Hú than the name of Hú? From attribute and name what comes to birth? Phantasy; and that phantasy shows the way to union with Him.",12
"Hast thou ever seen a subject that shows without (the existence of) an object that is shown: unless there is the road, there can never be the ghoul (which entices travelers to stray from the road). Hast thou ever seen a name without the reality (denoted by the name)? Or hast thou plucked a rose (gul) from the (letters) gáf and lám of (the word) gul? Thou hast pronounced the name: go, seek the thing named. Know that the moon is on high, not in the water of the stream. If thou wouldst pass beyond name and letter, oh, make thyself wholly purged of self. Like (polished) iron, lose the ferruginous colour; become in thy ascetic discipline (like) a mirror without rust.",12
"Make thyself pure from the attributes of self, that thou mayst behold thine own pure untarnished essence, And behold within thy heart (all) the sciences of the prophets, without book and without preceptor and master. The Prophet said, “Amongst my people are some who are one with me in nature and aspiration: Their spirits behold me by the same light by which I am beholding them.” Without the two Sahíhs and Traditions and Traditionists; nay, (they behold him) in the place where they drink the Water of Life.",12
"Know the secret of “In the evening I was a Kurd”; read the mystery of “In the morning I was an Arab.” And if you desire a parable of the hidden knowledge, relate the story of the Greeks and the Chinese. The story of the contention between the Greeks and the Chinese in the art of painting and picturing. The Chinese said, “We are the better artists”; the Greeks said, “The (superiority in) power and excellence belongs to us.” “I will put you to the test in this matter,” said the Sultan, “(and see) which of you are approved in your claim.”The Chinese and the Greeks began to debate: the Greeks retired from the debate.",12
"(Then) the Chinese said, “Hand over to us a particular room, and (let there be) one for you (as well).” There were two rooms with door facing door: the Chinese took one, the Greeks the other. The Chinese requested the King to give them a hundred colours: the King opened his treasury that they might receive that (which they sought). Every morning, by (his) bounty, the colours were dispensed from the treasury to the Chinese. The Greeks said, “No tints and colours are proper for our work, (nothing is needed) except to remove the rust.”",13
"They shut the door and went on burnishing: they became clear and pure like the sky. There is a way from many-colouredness to colourlessness: colour is like the clouds, and colourlessness is a moon. Whatsoever light and splendour you see in the clouds, know that it comes from the stars and the moon and the sun. When the Chinese had finished their work, they were beating drums for joy. The King entered and saw the pictures there: that (sight), as he encountered it, was robbing him of his wits.",13
"After that, he came towards the Greeks: they removed the intervening curtain. The reflexion of those (Chinese) pictures and works (of art) struck upon these walls which had been made pure (from stain). All that he had seen there (in the Chinese room) seemed more beautiful here: ’twas snatching the eye from the socket. The Greeks, O father, are the Súfís: (they are) without (independent of) study and books and erudition, But they have burnished their breasts (and made them) pure from greed and cupidity and avarice and hatreds.",13
"That purity of the mirror is, beyond doubt, the heart which receives images innumerable. That Moses (the perfect saint) holds in his bosom the formless infinite form of the Unseen (reflected) from the mirror of his heart. Although that form is not contained in Heaven, nor in the empyrean nor in the sphere of the stars, nor (in the earth which rests) on the Fish, Because (all) those are bounded and numbered—(yet is it contained in the heart): know that the mirror of the heart hath no bound. Here the understanding becomes silent or (else) it leads into error, because the heart is with Him (God), or indeed the heart is He.",13
"The reflexion of every image shines unto everlasting from the heart alone, both with plurality and without. Unto everlasting every new image that falls on it (the heart) is appearing therein without any imperfection. They that burnish (their hearts) have escaped from (mere) scent and colour: they behold Beauty at every moment without tarrying. They have relinquished the form and husk of knowledge, they have raised the banner of the eye of certainty. Thought is gone, and they have gained light: they have gained the throat (core and essence) and the sea (ultimate source) of gnosis.",13
"Death, of which all these (others) are sore afraid, this people (the perfect Súfís) are holding in derision. None gains the victory over their hearts: the hurt falls on the oyster-shell, not on the pearl. Though they have let go grammar (nahw) and jurisprudence (fiqh), yet they have taken up (instead) mystical self-effacement (mahw) and spiritual poverty (faqr). Ever since the forms of the Eight Paradises have shone forth, they have found the tablets of their (the Súfís') hearts receptive. (They receive) a hundred impressions from the empyrean and the starry sphere and the void: what impressions? Nay, ’tis the very sight of God. How the Prophet, on whom be peace, asked Zayd, “How art thou to-day and in what state hast thou risen?” and how Zaydanswered him, saying, “This morning I am a true believer, O Messenger of Allah.”",13
"One morning the Prophet said to Zayd, “How art thou this morning, O sincere Companion?” He replied, “(This morning I am) a faithful servant of God.” Again he (the Prophet) said to him, “Where is thy token from the garden of Faith, if it has bloomed?” He said, “I have been athirst in the daytime, at night I have not slept because of love and burning griefs, So that I passed through (and beyond) day and night, as the point of the spear passes through the shield; For beyond (the realm of contraries) nativity and continued growth are one: hundreds of thousands of years are the same as a single hour.",14
"Everlastingness and eternity are unified (yonder): the understanding hath no way thither by means of inquiry.” The Prophet said, “Where is the traveller's gift (that thou hast brought home) from this journey? Produce it. Where is the token of sincerity (that thou hast brought) from yon fair land?” Zayd said, “When (other) people see the sky, I behold the Empyrean with those who dwell there. The Eight Paradises and the Seven Hells are as visible to me as the idol to the idolater. I am distinguishing the people (here), one by one, like wheat from barley in the mill,",14
"So that who is for Paradise and who shall be a stranger (to Paradise) is as clear to me as (the difference between) snake and fish.” The day of birth for Anatolians and Ethiopians and every race (of mankind) is the Day when faces shall become white or black. Before this (birth), however sinful the spirit was, it was in the womb (of the body) and was hidden from the people. The damned are they that are damned in the mother's womb: all of them are known by the marks of God. The body, like a mother, is big with the spirit-child: death is the pangs and throes of birth.",14
"All the spirits that have passed over (to the next life) are waiting to see in what state that proud spirit shall be born. The Ethiopians (the damned spirits) say, “It belongs to us”; the Anatolians (the blessed spirits) say, “Nay, it is comely.” As soon as it is born into the world of spirit and (Divine) grace, there is no further difference (of opinion) between the whites (the blessed) and the blacks (the damned). If it is an Ethiopian (a damned spirit), the Ethiopians carry it off; and if it is an Anatolian (a blessed spirit), the Anatolians lead it away. Until it is born (into the next life), it is a riddle for (all) the world: few are they that know (the destiny of) the unborn.",14
"Such a one surely is seeing by the light of God, for he has the way (the means of knowing what is hidden) within the skin. Principium aquae seminis candidum est et pulchrum, but the reflexion of the spirit, (whether the spirit be) Anatolian or Ethiopian, Is giving colour (glory) to those (the Anatolians) who are most excellent in their (original) constitution, (while) it is bearing this (other) half (i.e. the Ethiopians) down to the lowest depth. This discourse hath no end. Hasten back, that we may not be left behind by the caravan's file of camels. On the Day when faces shall become white or black, by whom shall reverence still be paid to Turk and Hindoo (alike)?",14
"In the womb (of this world) Hindoo and Turk are not distinguishable, (but) when each is born (into the next world) he (the seer) sees that each is miserable or glorious (according to his spiritual nature). “I am seeing them all plainly, as (they shall be) on the Day of Resurrection, like (multitudes of) people, men and women. Hark, shall I tell or shall I stop my breath (keep silence)?” Mustafá (Mohammed) bit his (Zayd's) lip, as though to say, “Enough!” “O Messenger of Allah, shall I tell the mystery of the Gathering (on the Day of Judgement), shall I make the Resurrection manifest in the world to-day? Let me be, that I may rend the curtains asunder, that my (spiritual) substance may shine forth like a sun;",14
"That the sun may be eclipsed by me, that I may show (the difference between) the (fruitful) date-palm and the (barren) willow. I will show forth the mystery of Resurrection, the sterling coin and the coin mixed with alloy, The people of the left with their hands cut off; I will show forth the colour of infidelity and the colour of the (Prophet's) folk. I will lay bare the seven rifts (sins) of hypocrisy in the light of the moon that suffers no eclipse or waning. I will display the woollen frocks of the damned, I will cause the drums and kettledrums of the prophets to be heard.",14
"Hell and the Gardens (of Paradise) and the intermediate state I will bring clearly before the eyes of the infidels. I will display the pond of Kawthar heaving (with waves), which dashes water on their (the blessed ones') faces, (while) its sound (rings) in their ears; And those who are running athirst round Kawthar I will name one by one (and tell) who they are: Their shoulders are rubbing against my shoulder, their cries are piercing my ears. Before my eyes the people of Paradise, from free choice, clasp each other to their bosoms,",14
"Visiting one another's high places of honour and snatching kisses from the lips (of the houris). This ear of mine has become deafened by the cries of ‘Alas, Alas!’ (uttered) by the vile wretches (in Hell) and by the screams of ‘O sorrow!’ These are (only) hints. I would speak from the depth (of my knowledge), but I fear to offend the Messenger (of Allah).” He was speaking in this wise, intoxicated and distraught: the Prophet twitched his collar And said, “Beware! Draw (rein), for thy horse has become hot. (When) the reflexion of God is not ashamed (to speak the truth) strikes (on the heart), shame is gone.",14
"Thy mirror has shot out of the case: how shall mirror and balance speak falsehood? How shall mirror and balance stop their breath (suppress the truth) for fear of hurting and shaming any one? Mirror and balance are noble touchstones: if thou do service (sue) to them for two hundred years, Saying, ‘Conceal the truth for my sake, display the surplus and do not display the deficiency,’ They will say to thee, ‘Do not laugh at thy beard and moustache: mirror and balance, and then deceit and trickery!",14
"Since God has raised us up in order that by means of us it may be possible to know the truth, If this do not happen (if we fail to display the truth), what worth have we, O young man? How shall we become a standard for the face of the fair?’ But (said the Prophet) slip the mirror (back) into the cloth, if (Divine) illumination has made thy breast a Sinai.” He (Zayd) said, “Why, shall the Sun of the Truth and the Sun of Eternity be contained any wise under the armpit? It bursts asunder both armpit (baghal) and imposture (daghal); in its presence neither madness nor (soundness of) understanding remains.”",14
"He (the Prophet) said, “When thou layest one finger on an eye, thou seest the world empty of the sun. One finger-tip becomes a veil over the moon—and this is a symbol of God's covering— So that the (whole) world may be covered (hidden from view) by a single point, and the sun be eclipsed by a splinter.” Close thy lips and gaze on the depth of the sea (within thee): God made the sea subject to man, Even as the fountains of Salsabíl and Zanjabíl are under the control of the exalted ones of Paradise.",14
"The four rivers of Paradise are under our control; this is not (by) our might, ’tis (by) the command of God: We keep them flowing wheresoever we will, like magic (which takes its course) according to the desire of the magicians, Just as these two flowing eye-fountains (the two eyes) are under the control of the heart and subject to the command of the spirit. If it (the heart) will, they turn towards poison and the snake, and if it will, they turn to (edifying) consideration. If it will, they turn to sensuous things, and if it will, they turn to things clothed (in the forms of thought and phantasy).",14
"If it will, they advance towards universals, and if it will, they remain turned towards particulars. Similarly all the five senses are passing (in movement) according to the will and command of the heart, like the spool (in the hand of a weaver). All the five senses are moving and trailing their skirts (sweeping along) in whatever direction the heart indicates to them. Hand and foot are plainly under command of the heart, like the staff in the hand of Moses. If the heart will, at once the foot begins to dance, or flees from defect towards increase.",14
"If the heart will, the hand comes to terms with the fingers to write a book. The hand remains in (the grasp of) a hidden hand: it (the hidden hand) within has set the body outside (as its instrument). If it (the hidden hand) will, it (the external hand) becomes a snake to the enemy; and if it will, it becomes a helper to the friend; And if it will, a spoon in food; and if it will, a mace weighing ten maunds. I wonder what the heart is saying to them (the members of the body). ’Tis a marvelous connexion, a marvellous hidden link.",14
"Surely the heart has gotten the seal of Solomon, so that it has pulled the reins of (exerted control over) the five senses. Five external senses are easy for it to manage, five internal senses (faculties) are under its command. There are ten senses and seven limbs (of the body) et cetera: count over (to yourself) what is not mentioned (here). O heart, since thou art a Solomon in empire, cast thy seal-ring (powerful spell) upon peri and demon. If in this kingdom thou art free from deceit, the three demons will not take the seal outmof thy hand;",14
"After that, thy name will conquer the world: the two worlds (will be) ruled by thee like thy body. And if the demon take the seal off thy hand, thy kingdom is past, thy fortune is dead; After that, O servants (of God), “O sorrow!” is your inevitable doom till the day when ye are gathered together (for Judgement). And if thou art denying thy deceit, how wilt thou save thy soul from the scales and the mirror?How suspicion was thrown upon Luqmán by the slaves and fellow-servants who said that he had eaten the fresh fruit which they were bringing (to their master). In the eyes of his master, amongst (in comparison with) the (other) slaves, Luqmán was despicable on account of his body (outward aspect).",14
"He (the master) used to send the slaves to the garden, that fruit might come (be brought to him) for his pleasure. Amongst the slaves Luqmán was (despised) like a parasite; (he was) full of (spiritual) ideas, dark-complexioned as night. Those slaves, being impelled by greed, ate the whole of the fruit with enjoyment, And told their master that Luqmán had eaten it, (whereupon) the master became bitter and sorely displeased with Luqmán. When Luqmán inquired (and ascertained) the cause (of this), he opened his lips to reproach his master.",14
"“O sire,” said Luqmán, “an unfaithful servant is not approved in the sight of God. Put us all to the test, O noble sir: give us our fill of hot water (to drink), And afterwards make us run into a great plain, thou being mounted and we on foot. Then behold the evil-doer, (behold) the things that are done by Him who revealeth mysteries!” The master gave the servants hot water to drink, and they drank it in fear (of him).",14
"Afterwards he was driving them into the plains, and they were running amidst the cornfields. From distress they began to vomit: the (hot) water was bringing up the fruit from them. When Luqmán began to vomit from his navel (belly), there was coming up from within him (only) the pure water. Inasmuch as Luqmán's wisdom can show forth this, then what must be the wisdom of the Lord of existence! On the day when all the inmost thoughts shall be searched out, there will appear from you something latent, (the appearance of) which is not desired.",14
"When they shall be given hot water to drink, all the veils will be cut asunder (torn off) from that which is abhorred. The fire (of Hell) is made the torment of the infidels because fire is the (proper) test for stones. How oft, how oft, have we spoken gently to our stony hearts, and they would not accept the counsel! For a bad wound the vein gets (requires) a bad (severe) remedy: the teeth of the dog are suitable for the donkey's head. The wicked women to the wicked men is wisdom: the ugly is the mate and fitting (consort) for the ugly.",14
"Whatever, then, you wish to mate with, go, become absorbed in the loved (object), and assume its shape and qualities. If you wish for the light, make yourself ready to receive the light; if you wish to be far (from God), become self-conceited and far; And if you wish (to find) a way out of this ruined prison, do not turn your head away from the Beloved, but bow in worshipand draw nigh. The remainder of the story of Zayd (and what he said) in answer to the Prophet, on whom be peace. This discourse hath no end. “Arise, O Zayd, and tie a shackle on the Buráq (steed) of thy rational spirit. Since the rational spirit exposes faults, it is rending the curtains of concealment. ",14
"Concealment is desired by God for awhile. Drive away this drummer, bar the road! Do not gallop, draw rein, ’tis better it (thy spirit) should be veiled; ’tis better that every one should be gladdened by his own fancy. God is wishing that even His despairing ones should not avert their faces (refrain) from this worship (of Him). Even on the ground of a hope they become ennobled: for a few days (a short time) they are running at its stirrup (following Divine worship). He wishes that that mercy should shine upon all, on the evil and the good, because of the universality of His mercy.",14
"God is wishing that every prince and captive should be hopeful and fearful and afraid. This hope and fear are in the veil (separating the seen from the unseen), that they may be fostered behind this veil. When thou hast rent the veil, where are fear and hope? Might and majesty and (the power to inflict) probation belong to the unseen.” A young man on the bank of a river thought (to himself), “Our fisherman (here) is Solomon. (But) if this is he, why is he alone and disguised? And if not, why has he the aspect of Solomon?”",14
"Thus thinking, he remained in two minds until Solomon (once more) became king and absolute ruler. The demon departed and fled from his (Solomon's) kingdom and throne: the sword of his fortune shed that devil's blood. He put the ring upon his finger, the hosts of demons and peris assembled. The men came to look, amongst them he who had the fancy (that the fisherman was Solomon in disguise). When he opened his (Solomon's) hand and saw the ring, his pondering and seeking (to decide rightly) vanished all at once.",14
"Anxiety occurs (only) at the time when that (object of desire) is hidden: this searching is after the unseen. Whilst he was absent, fancy waxed strong in his breast: as soon as he was present, his fancy departed. If the radiant sky is not without rain, neither is the dark earth without vegetation. (God said), “I want (what is signified by the words) they believe in the unseen: on that account I have shut the window of the fleeting world. If I open its window as on the day of the (last) trump, how should I say, ‘Dost thou see any clefts therein?’”",14
"In order that in this darkness they may make endeavours (to find the way), they are turning, every one, their faces in some direction. For awhile things are reversed: the thief brings the magistrate to the gallows, So that many a sultan and man of lofty spirit becomes the slave of his own slave for awhile. Service (performed) in absence (through faith in the unseen) is fair and comely; when service is demanded (by God from us), ‘tis pleasing (to Him) that the absent should be remembered (that we should remember to perform what is due to Him, though He is unseen). Where (in what position) is one that praises the king in his presence, compared with one that is shamefaced in absence (from him)?",14
"The governor of a fortress who, on the border of the kingdom, far from the sultan and the shadow (protection) of the sultanate, Guards the fortress from enemies and will not sell it for boundless riches, Who, though absent from the king on the outskirt of the frontiers, keeps faith (with him) like one who is present— He in the king's sight is better than the rest who are serving in his presence and ready to devote their lives. Therefore half an atom of regard to one's duty in absence is better than a hundred thousand fold observance thereof in presence.",14
"Obedience (to God) and faith are praiseworthy now; after death, when all is plainly shown, they will be spurned. “Inasmuch as the unseen and the absent and the veil are better, close thy mouth: ’tis better for us to be silent. O brother, refrain from speech: God himself will make manifest the knowledge that is with Him (in His possession). Witness enough for the sun is its face: what thing is the greatest witness (of all)? God.” “Nay, speak I will, since both God and the angels and the men of learning are allied in setting forth (this truth).",14
"God and the angels and those learned in the sciences (of divinity) bear witness that there is no Lord except Him who endureth for ever.” Since God hath given testimony, who are the angels, that they should be associated in the testimony? (They are associated) because unsound (weak) eyes and hearts cannot support the radiance and (clear) testimony of the Sun, Like a bat, which cannot bear the glow of the sun and abandons hope. Know, then, that the angels, as we also, are helpers (co-witnesses)—displayers of the sun in heaven—",14
"Who say, “We have derived (our) light from a Sun, we have shone upon the weak, like vicegerents (of a mighty King).” (Whether they be like) the new moon or the moon seven days old or the full moon, every angel has his (particular) rank in respect of light and (spiritual) worth. Every angel, according to their (different) degrees, has (a portion of) that radiance, consisting of three or four (pairs of) luminous wings, Just as the wings of human intellects, amongst which there is great difference (in quality). Hence the associate of every human being in good and evil is that angel whose dignity is corresponding to his or hers.",14
"The stars shine, for the sake of guidance, upon the dim-sighted man who cannot bear even (the light of) the moon. How the Prophet, on whom be peace, said to Zayd, “Do not tell this mystery more plainly than this, and take care to comply (with the religious law).” The Prophet said, “My Companions are (like) the stars, a candle to travellers (on the Way), and meteors to be cast at the devils.” If every one had the eye and the strength to receive light from the sun of heaven, No moon and stars would be needed to serve as witnesses to (the existence of) a sun. The Moon (the Prophet) is saying to earth and cloud and shadow, “I am a man, I am one like you, (but) it is revealed to me (that your God is one God).",14
"Like you, I was dark in my nature: the Sun's revelation gave me such a light as this. I have a certain darkness in comparison with the (spiritual) suns, (but) I have light for the darknesses of (human) souls. I am faint (less bright than the Sun) in order that thou mayst be able to bear (my beams), for thou art not the man for (a man who can bear) the most radiant Sun. I was woven (mingled) together, like honey and vinegar, that I might find the way to (cure) sickness of heart. Since thou hast recovered from thine illness, O thou (that wert) in thrall (to it), leave the vinegar and continue to eat the honey.”",14
"(If) the throne of the heart has become restored to soundness and purged of sensuality, thereon the Merciful God isseated on His Throne. After this, God controls the heart without intermediary, since the heart has attained to this relation (with Him). This discourse hath no end. Where is Zayd, that I may counsel him not to seek notoriety? The (author's) return to the story of Zayd. You will not find Zayd now, for he has fled: he has darted away from the shoe-row and dropped his shoes. Who are you (that you should hope to find him)? Zayd cannot even find himself, (he has vanished) like the star on which the sun shone.",14
"You will find neither mark nor trace of him, you will not find a straw (star) in the straw-strewn Way (the Milky Way). Our senses and finite speech (reason) are obliterated in the knowledge and wisdom of our (Divine) King. Their (the God-intoxicated mystics') senses and understandings within (them) are (tossed), wave on wave, in (the sea of) they are assembled before Us. When night comes, ’tis again the time of (bearing) the burden: the stars, which had become hidden, go (again) to work. God gives back to the senseless ones their (lost) senses: (they return to consciousness) troop after troop, with rings (of mystic knowledge) in their ears,",14
"Dancing, waving their hands in praise (of God), triumphing (and crying), “O Lord, Thou hast brought us to life.” Those crumbled skins and bones have become (like) horsemen and have raised the dust: At Resurrection both the thankful and the ungrateful rush along from non-existence towards existence. Why do you turn away your head and pretend not to see? Did you not turn away your head at first, (when you were) in non- existence (and disbelieved that you would ever come into existence)? You had planted your foot (firmly) in non-existence, saying, “Who will uproot me from my place?”",14
"Are not you beholding the action of your Lord, who dragged you (into existence) by the forelock, Until He drew you into (all) these various states (of being), which were not in your thought or fancy? That non-existence is always His slave: work (in His service), O demon! Solomon is living. The demon is making large bowls like watering-troughs: he dare not say a word in refusal or in retort. Look at yourself, how you are trembling with fear (of non-existence): know that nonexistence also is constantly trembling (lest God should bring it into existence).",14
"And if you are grasping at (worldly) dignities, ’tis from fear too that you are suffering agony of spirit. Except love of the most beauteous God everything, though (outwardly) it is (pleasant like) eating sugar, is (in truth) agony of spirit. What is agony of spirit? To advance towards death and not grasp the Water of Life. People fix both their eyes on earth and death: they have a hundred doubts concerning the Water of Life. Strive that the hundred doubts may become ninety (may decrease): go (towards God) in the night (of this world), for if you slumber, the night will go (from you).",14
"In the dark night seek that (shining) Day: put in front (follow) the darkness consuming Reason. In the evil-coloured night there is much good: the Water of Life is the mate of darkness. How is it possible to lift up the head from slumber, whilst you are sowing a hundred such seeds of slothfulness? Dead (heavy) slumber and dead (unlawful) food became friends: the merchant fell asleep and the night-thief got to work. Do you not know who your enemies are? Those made of fire are enemies to the existence of those made of earth.",14
"Fire is the enemy of water and its children, even as water is an enemy to the life of fire. Water kills fire because it is the enemy and foe of the children of water. To proceed, this fire is the fire of lust, wherein is the root of sin and error. The external fire may be quenched by some water, (but) the fire of lust is bringing (you) to Hell. The fire of lust is not allayed by water, because it has the (insatiable) nature of Hell in respect of (inflicting) torment.",14
"What is the remedy for the fire of lust? The light of the Religion: your (the Moslems') light is the (means of) extinguishing the fire of the infidels. What kills this fire? The Light of God. Make the light of Abraham your teacher, That this body of yours, which resembles wood (faggots), may be delivered from the fire of the Nimrod-like flesh (nafs). Fiery lust is not diminished by indulging it: it is diminished, without any escape (inevitably), by leaving it (ungratified). So long as thou art laying faggots on a fire, how will the fire be extinguished by a carrier of faggots?",14
"When thou withholdest the faggots, the fire dies out, because fear of God carries (as it were) water to the fire. How should the fire blacken the beauteous face (of a soul) which lays (on itself) rose colour (derived) from the fear of God that is in (men's) hearts? How a conflagration occurred in the city (Medina) in the days of ‘Umar, may God be well-pleased with him. A conflagration occurred in the time of ‘Umar: it was devouring stones as though they were dry wood. It fell upon buildings and houses, until (at last) it darted at the wings and nests of birds. Half the city caught fire from the flames: water was afraid of it (the fire) and amazed.",14
"Some intelligent persons were throwing skins of water and vinegar on the fire, (But) out of spite (obstinacy) the fire was increasing: aid was coming to it from One who is infinite. The people came in haste to ‘Umar, saying, “Our fire will not be quenched at all by water.” He said, “That fire is one of God's signs: ’tis a flame from the fire of your wickedness. Discard water and deal out bread (in charity), discard avarice if ye are my people (followers).”",14
"The folk said to him, “We have opened our doors, we have been bountiful and devoted to generosity.” He replied, “Ye have given bread by rule and habit, ye have not opened your hands for the sake of God— (Only) for glory and for ostentation and for pride, not because of fear and piety and supplication.” Wealth is seed, and do not lay it in every salty ground: do not put a sword in the hand of every highwayman. Distinguish the friends of the Religion (ahl-i Dín) from the enemies of God (ahl-i kín): seek the man that sits with God, and sit with him.",14
"Every one shows favour to his own folk: the fool (who shows favour to the foolish) thinks he has really done (good and religious) work. How an enemy spat in the face of the Prince of the Faithful, ‘Alí, may God honour his person, and how ‘Alí dropped thesword from his hand. Learn how to act sincerely from ‘Alí: know that the Lion of God (‘Alí) was purged of (all) deceit. In fighting against the infidels he got the upper hand of (vanquished) a certain knight, and quickly drew a sword and made haste (to slay him). He spat on the face of ‘Alí, the pride of every prophet and every saint; He spat on the countenance before which the face of the moon bows low in the place of worship.",14
"‘Alí at once threw his sword away and relaxed (his efforts) in fighting him. That champion was astounded by this act and by his showing forgiveness and mercy without occasion. He said, “You lifted your keen sword against me: why have you flung it aside and spared me? What did you see that was better than combat with me, so that you have become slack in hunting me down? What did you see, so that such anger as yours abated, and so that such a lightning flashed and (then) recoiled?",15
"What did you see, that from seeing (only) the reflexion thereof a flame appeared in my heart and soul? What did you see, beyond (material) existence and space, that was better than life?— and (so) you gave me life. In bravery you are the Lion of the Lord: in generosity who indeed knows who (what) you are? In generosity you are (like) Moses' cloud in the desert, whence came the dishes of food and bread incomparable.” The clouds give wheat which man with toil makes cooked (easy to digest) and sweet as honey.",15
"(But) Moses' cloud spread the wings of mercy and gave cooked and sweet food that was (ready to be eaten) without trouble. For the sake of those (beggars) who partook of its bounty, its (the cloud's) mercy raised a banner (displayed itself) in the world. During forty years that ration and largesse did not fail the hopeful people (of Israel) for a single day, Until they too, because of their vileness, arose and demanded leeks and green herbs and lettuce. O people of Ahmad (Mohammed), who are of the noble, (for you) that food is continuing till the Resurrection.",15
"When (the Prophet's saying), “I pass the night with my Lord,” was uttered, (the words) “He gives (me) food” and “He gives (me) drink” referred metaphorically to (spiritual) food (and drink). Accept this (saying) without any (perverse) interpretation, that it may come into your throat (as agreeably) as honey and milk. Because interpretation (alteration of the meaning) is a rejection of the gift, since he (the interpreter) regards that real (original) meaning as faulty. The view that it is faulty arises from the weakness of his understanding: Universal Reason is the kernel, and our reason is like the rind. Alter yourself, not the Traditions (of the Prophet): abuse your (dull) brain, not the rose garden (the true sense which you cannot apprehend).",15
"“O ‘Alí, thou who art all mind and eye, relate a little of that which thou hast seen! The sword of thy forbearance hath rent my soul, the water of thy knowledge hath purified my earth. Tell it forth! I know that these are His (God's) mysteries, because ’tis His work (way) to kill without sword.He that works without tools and without limbs, He that bestows these profitable gifts, Causes the intelligence to taste myriads of wines in such wise that eyes and ears are unaware.",15
"Tell it forth, O falcon of the empyrean that findest goodly prey, that (I may know) what thou hast seen at this time from the Maker. Thine eye has learned to perceive the Unseen, (while) the eyes of bystanders are sealed.” One man is beholding a moon plainly, while another sees the world dark, And another beholds three moons together. These three persons (beholders) are seated in one place, yea (verily). The eyes of all three are open, and the ears of all three are sharp (attentive); (they are) fastened on thee and in flight from me.",15
"Is this an enchantment of the eye? (Or) is it a marvellous hidden grace? On thee is the form of the wolf, and on me is the quality (beauty) of Joseph. If the worlds are eighteen thousand and more, these eighteen (thousand) are not subject (accessible) to every eye. “Reveal the mystery, O ‘Alí, thou who art approved (by God), O thou who art good fate after evil fate. Either do thou declare that which thy reason hath found, or I will tell that which hath shone forth on me. From thee it shone forth on me: how shouldst thou hide it? Without tongue thou art darting rays of light, like the moon.",15
"But if the moon's orb come to speech, it more quickly leads the night-travellers into the (right) way. They become safe from error and heedlessness: the voice of the moon prevails over the voice of the ghoul. Inasmuch as the moon (even) without speech is showing the way, when it speaks it becomes light upon light. Since thou art the gate of the city of Knowledge, since thou art the beams of the sun of Clemency, Be open, O Gate, to him that seeks the gate, so that by means of thee the husks may reach the core.",15
"Be open unto everlasting, O Gate of Mercy, O Entrance-hall to None is like unto Him.” Every air and mote is indeed a place for vision (of God), (but so long as it is) unopened, who says “Yonder is a door”? Unless the Watcher open a door, this idea never stirs within. When a door is opened, he (on whom this idea has dawned) becomes amazed, grows wings, and begins to fly on (the wings of) the idea. A careless man suddenly found the treasure in the ruin: after that, he was hastening to (search in) every ruin.",15
"Till you gain the pearl from one dervish, how should you seek the pearl from another dervish? Though opinion run with its own feet for (many) years, it will not pass beyond the cleft of its own nostrils. Say, are you seeing aught except your nose? Say, how will you see if you turn up your nose (in self-conceit)? How that infidel asked ‘Alí, may God honour his person, saying, “Since thou wert victorious over such a man as I am, how didst thou drop the sword from thy hand?” He said, “Speak, O Prince of the Faithful, that my soul may stir within my body, like the embryo.” How hath the embryo the means (of stirring) during the period when it is ruled (by the stars)? It comes (turns) from the stars towards the sun.",15
"When the time comes for the embryo to receive the (vital) spirit, at that time the sun becomes its helper. This embryo is brought into movement by the sun, for the sun is quickly endowing it with spirit. From the other stars this embryo received only an impression, until the sun shone upon it. By which way did it become connected in the womb with the beauteous sun? By the hidden way that is remote from our sense-perception. The sun in heaven hath many ways:",15
"The way whereby gold receives nourishment, and the way whereby the (common) stone is made a jacinth, And the way whereby it makes the ruby red, and the way whereby it gives the lightning-flash to the (iron) horse-shoe, And the way whereby it ripens the fruit, and the way whereby it gives heart to one distraught (with fear). “Say it forth, O falcon with shining wings who hast learned (to be familiar) with the King and with his fore-arm. Say it forth, O royal falcon that dost catch the ‘Anqá, O thou that dost vanquish an army by thyself, not with (the aid of) an army.",15
"Thou alone art the (whole) community, thou art one and a hundred thousand. Say it forth, O thou to whose falcon thy slave has fallen a prey. Wherefore this mercy in the place of vengeance? Whose way is it to give the hand to a dragon?” How the Prince of the Faithful made answer (and explained) what was the reason of his dropping the sword from his handon that occasion. He said, “I am wielding the sword for God's sake, I am the servant of God, I am not under the command of the body. I am the Lion of God, I am not the lion of passion: my deed bears witness to my religion. In war I am (manifesting the truth of) thou didst not throw when thou threwest: I am (but) as the sword, and the wielder is the (Divine) Sun.",15
"I have removed the baggage of self out of the way, I have deemed (what is) other than God to be non-existence. I am a shadow, the Sun is my lord; I am the chamberlain, I am not the curtain (which prevents approach) to Him. I am filled with the pearls of union, like a (jewelled) sword: in battle I make (men) living, not slain. Blood does not cover the sheen of my sword: how should the wind sweep away my clouds? I am not a straw, I am a mountain of forbearance and patience and justice: how should the fierce wind carry off the mountain?”",15
"That which is removed from its place by a wind is rubbish, for indeed the contrary winds are many. The wind of anger and the wind of lust and the wind of greed swept away him that performed not the (ritual) prayers. “I am a mountain, and my being is His building; and if I become like a straw, my wind (the wind that moves me) is His wind. My longing is not stirred save by His wind; my captain is naught but love of the One. Anger is king over kings, and to me it is a slave: even anger I have bound under the bridle.",15
"The sword of my forbearance hath smitten the neck of my anger; the anger of God hath come on me like mercy. I am plunged in light although my roof is ruined; I have become a garden although I am (styled) Bú Turáb (the father of dust). Since (the thought of something) other than God has intervened, it behoves (me) to sheathe my sword, That my name may be he loves for God's sake, that my desire may be he hates for God's sake, That my generosity may be he gives for God's sake, that my being may be he withholds for God's sake.",15
"My stinginess is for God's sake, my bounty is for God's sake alone: I belong entirely to God, I do not belong to any one (else); And that which I am doing for God's sake is not (done in) conformity, it is not fancy and opinion, it is naught but intuition. I have been freed from effort and search, I have tied my sleeve to the skirt of God. If I am flying, I behold the place to which I soar; and if I am circling, I behold the axis on which I revolve; And if I am dragging a burden, I know whither: I am the moon, and the Sun is in front of me as the guide.”",15
"There is no means (possibility) of communicating more than this to the people: in the river there is no room for the Sea. I speak low according to the measure of (their) understandings: ’tis no fault, this is the practice of the Prophet. “I am free from self-interest: hear the testimony of a freeman, for the testimony of slaves is not worth two barleycorns.” In the religious law the testimony of a slave has no value at (the time of) litigation and judgement. (Even) if thousands of slaves bear witness on thy behalf, the law does not accept their testimony as worth a straw.",15
"In God's sight the slave of lust is worse than menials and slaves brought into servitude, For the latter becomes free at a single word from his master, while the former lives sweet but dies sour and bitter. The slave of lust hath no (means of) release at all except through the grace of God and His special favour. He has fallen into a pit that has no bottom, and that is his (own) sin: it is not (Divine) compulsion and injustice. He has cast himself into such a pit that I find no rope capable of (reaching) its bottom.",15
"I will make an end. If this discourse go further, not only hearts but rocks will bleed. (If) these hearts have not bled, ’tis not because of (their) hardness, ’tis (because of) perplexity and preoccupation and ill- fatedness. They will bleed one day when blood is no use to them: do thou bleed at a time when (thy) blood is not rejected. Inasmuch as the testimony of slaves is not accepted, the approved witness is he that is not the slave of the ghoul (of sensuality). (The words) We have sent thee as a witness came in the Warning (the Qur’án), because he (the Prophet) was entirely free from (creaturely) existence.",15
"“Since I am free, how should anger bind me? Nothing is here but Divine qualities. Come in! Come in, for the grace of God hath made thee free, because His mercy had the precedence over His wrath. Come in now, for thou hast escaped from the peril: thou wert a (common) stone, the Elixir hath made thee a jewel. Thou hast been delivered from unbelief and its thorn-thicket: blossom like a rose in the cypress-garden of Hú (God). Thou art I and I am thou, O illustrious one: thou wert ‘Alí— how should I kill ‘Alí?",15
"Thou hast committed a sin better than any act of piety, thou hast traversed Heaven in a single moment.” Very fortunate (was) the sin which the man committed: do not rose-leaves spring from a thorn? Was not the sin of ‘Umar and his attempt on (the life of) the Prophet leading him to the gate of acceptance? Was not Pharaoh because of the magic of the magicians drawing them (to himself), and did not (spiritual) fortune come to their aid? Had it not been for their magic and denial (of Moses), who would have brought them to rebellious Pharaoh?",15
"How would they have seen the rod and the miracles? Disobedience (to God) became obedience, O disobedient people. God hath smitten the neck of despair, inasmuch as sin and disobedience have become obedience. Since He changes evil acts (into good), He makes it (the disobedience) an act of obedience in despite of slanderers (devils). By this (mercy of God) the stoned (accursed) Devil is driven away and bursts with envy and is cloven asunder. He strives to foster a sin (in us) and by means of that sin bring us into a pit;",15
"When he sees that the sin has become an act of obedience (to God), there comes round for him an unblest hour. “Come in! I open the door to thee. Thou spattest (on me) and I give thee a present. Such things I am giving to the doer of iniquity: (thou seest) in what fashion I lay my head before the left foot. What then do I bestow on the doer of righteousness? Know thou, (I bestow) treasures and kingdoms everlasting. How the Prophet, on whom be peace, said in the ear of the stirrup-holder of the Prince of the Faithful (‘Alí), may Godhonour his person, “I tell thee, ‘Alí will be slain by thy hand.” I am such a man that the honey of my kindness did not become poison in wrath (even) against my murderer.",15
"The Prophet said in the ear of my servant that one day he would sever this head of mine from my neck. The Prophet by (Divine) inspiration informed my friend that in the end my destruction would be (wrought) by his hand. He (my friend) says, ‘Kill me first, in order that this hateful crime may not proceed from me.’ I say, ‘Since my death is (to come) from thee, how can I seek to evade the destiny (of God)?’ He falls before me, saying, ‘O generous man, for God's sake cleave me in twain,",15
"That this evil end may not come upon me, and that my soul may not burn (with grief) for (thee who art) its (very) life.’ I say, ‘Go: the Pen (of Divine ordainment) is dry; by that Pen many a (lofty) landmark is overthrown. There is no hatred of thee in my soul, because I do not regard this (act) as (proceeding) from thee. Thou art God's instrument, God's hand is the (real) agent: how should I assail and oppose God's instrument?’” He (the knight) said, “For what reason, then, is retaliation (sanctioned)?” “’Tis from God, too,” said ‘Alí, “and that is a hidden mystery.",15
"If He takes offence at His own act, (yet) He causes gardens (of good) to grow from that taking offence. It beseems Him to take offence at His own act, inasmuch as in vengeance and mercy He is One. In this city of phenomena He is the Prince; in (all) the realms (of the world) He is the Ruler. If He breaks His own instrument, He mends that which has become broken.” Recognise, O noble sir, the indication of (the text), (Whatever) verse We shall cancel or cause to be forgotten, followed by We shall bring a better.",15
"Every (religious) law that He (God) has cancelled—He has taken away grass and brought roses in exchange. Night cancels the business of day: behold an inanimateness (inertia) that enlightens the intellect! Again, night is cancelled by the light of day, so that the inanimateness is consumed by that fire-kindling one. Although that sleep and rest are darkness, is not the Water of Life within the darkness? Did not minds become refreshed in that darkness? Did not a pause (in recitation) become the source of (increased beauty in) the voice?",15
"For contraries are manifested by means of contraries: in the black core (of the heart) He (God) created the everlasting light (of love). The wars of the Prophet became the pivot (determining cause) of peace: the peace of this latter age was (produced) from those wars. That heart-ravisher cut off hundreds of thousands of heads, in order that the heads of the (whole) world's people might win security. The gardener lops the harmful bough, in order that the date-palm may gain (tallness of) stature and goodness. The expert (gardener) digs up the weeds from the garden, in order that his garden and fruit may look flourishing.",15
"The physician extracts bad teeth, in order that the beloved (patient) may be saved from pain and sickness. Many advantages are (concealed) within defects: for martyrs there is life in death. When the (martyr's) throat has been cut that swallowed the daily bread, (the spiritual blessings implied in the text) receiving the (Divine) bounty, rejoicing, shall be delicious (to him). When the throat of an animal is cut duly (in the manner prescribed by law), there grows (from it) the throat of man, and its excellence is increased (thereby). When a (martyred) man's throat is cut, come, consider what the result will be! Judge of this (case) by the analogy of that (case).",15
"A third throat will be born, and care of it will be (taken by) the sherbet of God and His lights. The throat that has been cut drinks (the Divine) sherbet, but (only) the throat that has been delivered from Nay and has died in Yea. Make an end, O pusillanimous short-fingered (infirm) one! How long will the life of thy spirit be (sustained) by bread? Like the willow, thou hast no fruit, because thou hast lost thine honour for the sake of white bread. If the sensual soul cannot refrain from this bread, take the elixir and turn thy copper into gold.",15
"Wouldst thou wash thy garment (clean), O so-and-so, do not avert thy face from the bleachers' quarter. Although the bread has broken thy fast, cling to Him that binds what is broken, and ascend! Inasmuch as His hand binds what is broken, it follows that His breaking is assuredly mending. It thou break it, He will say to thee, “Come, make it whole (again)”; and thou hast neither hand nor foot (thou art helpless). Therefore He (alone) has the right to break, for He (alone) can mend what has been broken.",15
"He that knows how to sew (together) knows how to tear (asunder); whatsoever He sells, He buys (something) better (in exchange). He lays the house in ruins, upside down; then in one moment He makes it more habitable (than it was before). If He sever one head from the body, He at once raises up hundreds of thousands of heads (for the beheaded person). If He had not ordained a retaliation upon the guilty, or if He had not said, “In retaliation there is (for you) a life,” Who would have the stomach (would dare) of himself (on his own responsibility) to wield (draw) a sword against him that is a thrall to the decree of God?—",15
"Because every one whose eyes He (God) hath opened would know that the slayer was constrained (to slay) by (Divine) predestination. Any one on whom that predestination became a collar (any one subjected to it) would strike a sword-blow even at the head of his (own) child. Go, fear (God) and do not rail at the wicked: know thine own impotence before the snare of the (Divine) decree. How Adam, on whom be peace, marvelled at the perdition of Iblís and showed vanity. One day Adam looked with contempt and scorn on Iblís who is damned. He behaved with self-conceit and became self-approving: he laughed at the plight of accursed Iblís.",15
"The jealousy of God cried out (against him)—“O chosen one, thou art ignorant of the hidden mysteries (of His providence). If He should turn the fur inside out, He would tear up from root and bottom (even) the (firmest) mountain (of faith); At that instant He would rend the veil of (put to shame) a hundred Adams and bring (to light) a hundred Devils newly converted to Islam.” Adam said, “I repent of this look; I will not think so disrespectfully again.” O Help of them that call for help, lead us (aright)! There is no (cause for) pride in knowledge or riches.",15
"Do not let a heart stray that Thou hast guided by Thy grace, and avert the evil which the Pen has written. Let the evil of Thy ordainment pass from our souls: do not cut us off from those who are well-pleased (with Thee). There is naught more bitter than separation from Thee: without Thy protection there is naught but perplexity. Our (worldly) goods waylay (and plunder) our (spiritual) goods: our bodies tear the garment (of spirituality) from our souls. Inasmuch as (the evil wrought by) our hand devours (the good towards which we move) our foot, how shall any one save his soul without Thy security?",15
"And (even) if (unaided) he save his soul from these awful dangers, he will (only) have saved a stock of misfortune and fear, Because the soul, when it is not united with the Beloved, is blind and blue (miserable) with itself for ever. When Thou wilt not give him admission (to Thy presence) —even suppose he has saved his soul, regard as dead the soul that would live without Thee. If Thou art upbraiding Thy slaves, that is suitable to Thee, O Thou whose every wish is fulfilled. And if Thou say that the sun and moon are scum, and if Thou say that the (straight) stature of the cypress is (bent) double,",15
"And if Thou call the empyrean and the sky contemptible, and if Thou say that the mine and the sea are poor— That is proper in reference to Thy perfection: Thine is the power of perfecting (all) mortalities, For Thou art holy (and free) from danger and from non-existence: Thou art He that brings the non-existent ones into being and endows (them with existence). He that made to grow can burn (destroy), because when He has torn, He can sew (mend). Every autumn He burns (withers) the garden; (then) He makes to grow again the rose that dyes (the garden),",15
"Saying, “O thou who wert withered, come forth, be fresh, once more be fair and of fair renown!” The eye of the narcissus became blind: He restored it; the throat of the reed was cut: He himself fostered it again (and revived it). Since we are made (by God) and are not makers, we are not (entitled to be anything) but humble and content. We all are of the flesh and busy with fleshliness: if Thou call us not (to Thyself), we all are Ahrimans (Devils). (If) we have been delivered from Ahriman, (it is only) because Thou hast redeemed our souls from blindness.",15
"Thou art the Guide of every one that hath life: who (of what account) is the blind man without staff and guide? Excepting Thee (alone), whatsoever is sweet or unsweet is man-destroying and the essence of fire. Any one to whom fire is a refuge and support becomes both a Magian and a Zoroaster. Everything except Allah is vain: verily the grace of Allah is a cloud pouring abundantly and continually. Returning to the story of the Prince of the Faithful, ‘Alí—may God honour his person!— and how generously he behavedto his murderer. Go back to ‘Alí and his murderer, and the kindness he showed to the murderer, and his superiority (moral and spiritual excellence).",15
"He said, “Day and night I see the murderer with my eyes, (but) I have no anger against him, Because death has become sweet as manna to me: my death has laid fast hold of resurrection.” The death of deathlessness is lawful to us, the provision of unprovidedness is a bounty to us. ’Tis death outwardly but life inwardly: apparently ’tis a cutting-off (decease), in secret (in reality) ’tis permanence (life without end). To the embryo in the womb birth is a going (to another state of existence): in the world it (the embryo) blossoms anew.",15
"“Since I have intense love and longing for death, the prohibition do not cast yourselves (into destruction) is (meant) for me, Because (only) the sweet berry is prohibited; (for) how should it become necessary to prohibit the sour one? The berry that has a sour kernel and rind—its very sourness and disagreeableness are (serve as) a prohibition of it. To me the berry of dying has become sweet: (the text) nay, they are living has come (from God) on my account. Slay me, my trusty friends, slay me, vile as I am: verily, in my being slain is my life for evermore.",15
"Verily, in my death is my life, O youth—how long shall I be parted from my home? Until when? If there were not in my staying (in this world) my separation (from God), He would not have said, ‘Verily, we are returning toHim.’” The returning one is he that comes back to his (native) city, and (fleeing) from the revolution of Time approaches the Unity. How the stirrup-holder of ‘Alí, may God honour his person, came (to him), saying, “For God's sake, kill me and deliver me from this doom.” “He came back, saying, ‘O‘ Alí, kill me quickly, that I may not see that bitter moment and hour. Shed my blood, I make it lawful to thee, so that my eye may not behold that resurrection’.",15
"I said, ‘If every atom should become a murderer and, dagger in hand, go to attack thee, None (of them) could cut from thee the tip of a single hair, since the Pen has written against thee such a line (of doom). But do not grieve: I am intercessor for thee: I am the spirit's master, I am not the body's slave. This body hath no value in my sight: without my body I am the noble (in spirit), the son of the noble. Dagger and sword have become my sweet basil: my death has become my banquet and narcissus-plot.’” ",15
"He that hamstrings (mortifies) his body in this fashion, how should he covet the Princedom and the Caliphate? Outwardly he strives after power and authority, (but only) that he may show to princes the (right) way and judgement; That he may give another spirit to the Princedom; that he may give fruit to the palm tree of the Caliphate. Explaining that the motive of the Prophet, on whom be peace, in seeking to conquer Mecca and other (places) than Meccawas not love of worldly dominion, inasmuch as he has said “This world is a carcase,” but that on the contrary it was by thecommand (of God). Likewise the Prophet's struggle to conquer Mecca—how can he be suspected of (being inspired by) love of this world? He who on the day of trial shut his eyes and heart to the treasury of the Seven Heavens,",15
"(When) the horizons of all the Seven Heavens were full of houris and genies (who had come) to gaze upon him, Having arrayed themselves for his sake—how indeed should he care for anything except the Beloved? He had become so filled with magnification of God, that even those nearest to God would find no way (of intruding) there. “In Us (in Our unity) is no room for a prophet sent as an apostle, nor yet for the Angels or the Spirit. Do ye, therefore, understand!” He (also) said, “We are má zágh (that is, Our eye did not rove), we are not (looking for carrion) like crows (zágh); We are intoxicated with (enraptured by) the Dyer, we are not intoxicated with the garden (of flowers with their many dyes).”",15
"Inasmuch as to the eye of the Prophet the treasuries of the celestial spheres and intelligences seemed (worthless) as a straw, What, then, would Mecca and Syria and ‘Iráq be (worth to him), that he should show fight and longing (to gain possession of them)? That thought and opinion (of his motive) is the hypocrite's, who judges (the Prophet) from the analogy of his own wicked soul. When you make yellow glass a veil (between your eyes and the sun), you see all the sunlight yellow. Break those blue and yellow glasses, in order that you may know (distinguish) the dust and the man (who is concealed by it).",15
"The dust (of the body) has lifted up its head (risen) around the (spiritual) horseman: you have fancied the dust to be the man of God. Iblís saw (only) the dust, and said, “How should this offspring of clay (Adam) be superior to me of the fiery brow?” So long as thou art regarding the holy (prophets and saints) as men, know that that view is an inheritance from Iblís. If thou art not the child of Iblís, O contumacious one, then how has the inheritance of that cur come to thee? “I am not a cur, I am the Lion of God, a worshipper of God: the lion of God is he that has escaped from (phenomenal) form.",15
"The lion of this world seeks a prey and provision; the lion of the Lord seeks freedom and death. Inasmuch as in death he sees a hundred existences, like the moth he burns away (his own) existence.” Desire for death became the badge of the sincere, for this word (declaration) was (made) a test for the Jews. He (God) said in the Qur‘án, “O people of the Jews, death is treasure and gain to the sincere. Even as there is desire for profit (in the hearts of the worldly), the desire to win death is better than that (in the eyes of the sincere).",15
"O Jews, for the sake of (being held in) honour by men of worth, let this wish be uttered on your tongues.” Not a single Jew had so much courage (as to respond), when Mohammed raised this banner (gave this challenge). He said, “If they should utter this on their tongues, truly not one Jew would be left in the world.” Then the Jews brought the property (tribute in kind) and land-tax, saying, “Do not put us to shame, O Lamp (of the world).” “There is no end in sight to this discourse: give me thy hand, since thine eye hath seen the Friend.”",15
"The damned wretch is an elixir which transmutes into poison and snakes; (his elixir is) contrary to the elixir of the God-fearing man. How the Súfí enjoined the servant to take care of his beast and how the servant said, “Lá hawl.” A Súfí was wandering round the world till one night he became a guest at a monastery (for Súfís). He had a beast (ass): he tied it in the stable, (while) he (himself) sat at the top of the dais with his friends. Then he engaged with his friends in (mystical) meditation: the presence of the friend (of God) is a book, (and) more. The Súfí's book is not (composed of) ink and letters: it is naught but a heart white as snow.",16
"The scholar's provision is (consists of) pen-marks (written letters and words). What is the Súfí's provision? Footmarks. He (the Súfí) stalks the game, like a hunter: he sees the musk-deer's track and follows the footprints. For some while the track of the deer is (the) proper (clue) for him, (but) afterwards ’tis the navel (musk-gland) of the deer that is his guide. When he has given thanks for (having been favoured with knowledge of) the track and has traversed the way, of necessity by means of that track he arrives at a goal. To go one stage (guided) by the scent of the musk-gland is better than a hundred stages of (following) the track and roaming about.",16
"The heart that is the rising-place of the moonbeams (of Divine light) is the opening of the doors (of Reality) for the gnostic. To you it is a wall, to them it is a door; to you a stone, to (those) venerated ones a pearl. What you see plainly in the mirror—the Pír sees more than that in the brick. The Pírs are they whose spirits, before this world existed, were in the Sea of (Divine) bounty. Before (the creation of) this body they passed (many) lifetimes; before the sowing they took up (harvested) the wheat.",16
"They have received the spirit before (the creation of) the form; they have bored the pearls before (the creation of) the sea. (Whilst) consultation was going on as to bringing mankind into existence, their spirits were in the Sea of (Divine) Omnipotence up to the throat. When the angels were opposing that (creation of man), they (the Pírs) were secretly clapping their hands (in derision) at the angels. He (the Pír) was made acquainted with the (material) form of every existent being, before this Universal Soul became fettered (by materiality). Before the (creation of the) heavens they have seen Saturn, before the (existence of) seeds they have seen the bread.",16
"Without brain and mind they were full of thought, without army and battle they gained victory. That immediate intuition (intuitive knowledge) in relation to them is thought; else, indeed, in relation to those who are far (from God) it is vision. Thought is of the past and future; when it is emancipated from these two, the difficulty is solved. The spirit has beheld the wine in the grape, the spirit has beheld thing (entity) in nothing (nonentity); It has beheld every conditioned thing as unconditioned, it has beheld the genuine coin and the alloyed before (the existence of) the mine;",16
"Before the creation of grapes it has quaffed wines and shown the excitements (of intoxication). In hot July they (the Pírs) see December; in the sunbeams they see the shade. In the heart of the grape they have seen the wine; in absolute faná (privation of objectivity) they have seen the object. The sky is draining draughts from their circling cup, the sun is clad in cloth of gold by their bounty. When you see two of them met together as friends, they are one, and at the same time (they are) six hundred thousand.",16
"Their numbers are in the likeness of waves: the wind will have brought them into number (into plurality from unity). The Sun, which is the spirits, became separated (broken into rays) in the windows, which are bodies. When you gaze on the Sun's disk, it is itself one, but he that is screened by (his perception of) the bodies is in some doubt. Separation (plurality) is in the animal spirit; the human spirit is one essence. Inasmuch as God sprinkled His light upon them (mankind), (they are essentially one): His light never becomes separated (in reality).",16
"O my comrade on the way, dismiss thy weariness for a moment, that I may describe a single mole (grain) of that Beauty. The beauty of His state cannot be set forth: what are both the worlds (temporal and spiritual)? The reflexion of His mole. When I breathe a word concerning His beauteous mole, my speech would fain burst my body. Like an ant, I am so happy in this granary that I am dragging a burden too great for me. How the explanation of the (inner) meaning of the tale was stopped because of the hearer's desire to hear the superficialform of it. When will He who is envied by Light allow me to tell that which is obligatory and ought to be told?",16
"The sea casts foam in front (of it) and makes a barrier: it draws back and after drawing back flows in (again). Hear what has interfered (hindered my exposition) at the present time: methinks the hearer's mind has wandered elsewhere. His thoughts have turned to the Súfí guest: he is sunk up to the neck (wholly absorbed) in that business. (Therefore) it behoves me to go back from this discourse to that story in order to describe what happened (to him). O dear friend, do not fancy the Súfí is the (external) form (which you behold): how long, like children, (will you be content) with walnuts and raisins?",16
"Our body is (as) walnuts and raisins, O son; if you are a man, relinquish these two things; And (even) if you do not relinquish them (by your own act), the grace of God will enable you to pass beyond the nine tiers (of Heaven). Now listen to the outward form of the tale, but take heed to separate the grain from the chaff.How the people of the caravan supposed the Súfí's beast was ill. When at last (the meditation of) that circle of Súfís who were seeking (spiritual) profit came to an end (culminated) in ecstasy and enthusiasm, They brought dishes of food for the guest, and he then bethought him of his beast.",16
"He said to the famulus (the servant of the Súfís), “Go into the stable and make the straw and barley all right for the animal.” “Good gracious!” he replied, “why this saying overmuch? These things have been my care since long ago.” The Súfí said, “First wet his barley, for ’tis an old ass, and his teeth are shaky.” “Good gracious!” said he, “why are you telling (me) this, Sir? They are taught by me (to make) these arrangements.” The Súfí said, “First of all take off his saddle and (then) put the salve of manbal on his sore back.”",16
"“Good gracious!” exclaimed the servant. “Why, O purveyor of wisdom, I have had a thousand guests of your sort, And all have departed from us well-pleased: the guest is (dear to us as) our life and our kinsman.” The Súfí said, “Give him water, but (let it be) lukewarm.” “Good gracious!” cried the other, “I am ashamed of you.” The Súfí said, “Put (only) a little straw in his barley.” “Good gracious! Cut short this speech,” he replied. The Súfí said, “Sweep his place (clear) of stones and dung, and if it is wet, sprinkle dry earth on it.”",16
"“Good gracious!” cried he, “implore God's grace, O father and say little (give few instructions) to a messenger who knows his business.” The Súfí said, “Take the comb and curry the ass's back.” “Good gracious! do have some shame, O father,” said he. The servant said this and briskly girded up his loins. “I go,” said he; “first I will fetch the straw and barley.” Off he went and never thought of the stable at all: he gave that Súfí (a pretence like) the sleep of the hare. The servant went off to (join) some rascals and made a mockery of the Súfí's admonition.",16
"The Súfí was fatigued by his journey and stretched his limbs (lay down to sleep): with his eyes closed he was dreaming That his ass was left (helpless) in the clutch of a wolf, (which) was tearing pieces (of flesh) from its back and thighs. “Good gracious!” he exclaimed, “what sort of melancholy (madness) is this? Oh, where is that kindly servant?” Again he would see his ass going along the road and falling now into a well and now into a ditch. He was dreaming various unpleasant dreams; he was reciting the Fátiha and the Qári‘a.",16
"He said (to himself), “What can be done to help? My friends have hurried out: they have departed and made all the doors fast.” Again he would say, “Oh, I wonder—that wretched servant! Did not he partake of bread and salt with us? I showed him nothing but courtesy and mildness: why should he on the contrary show hatred towards me? Every enmity must rest on some cause; otherwise, our common humanity would dictate faithfulness (in friendship).” Then he would say again, “When had Adam, the kind and generous, done an injury to Iblís?",16
"What was done by man to snake and scorpion that they wish (to inflict) death and pain upon him? To rend is the instinct of the wolf: after all, this envy is conspicuous in mankind.” Again he would say, “It is wrong thus to think evil: why have I such thoughts against my brother?” Then he would say, “Prudence consists in your thinking evil: how shall he that thinks no evil remain unhurt?” The Súfí was in (this) anxiety, and (meanwhile) the ass was in such a plight that—may it befall our enemies!",16
"That poor ass was amidst earth and stones, with his saddle crooked and his halter torn, Killed (exhausted) by the journey, without fodder all the night long, now at the last gasp and now perishing. All night the ass was repeating, “O God, I give up the barley; (but am I to have) less than one handful of straw?” With mute eloquence he was saying, “O Shaykhs, (have) some pity, for I am consumed (with anguish) because of this raw impudent rogue.” What that ass suffered of pain and torment, the land-bird suffers (the same) in a flood of water.",16
"Then (all) that night till dawn the wretched ass, from exceeding hunger, rolled on his side. Day rose. The servant came at morn and quickly looked for the saddle and laid it on the ass's back. After the fashion of ass-dealers he gave him two or three blows (with a goad): he did to the ass what is befitting from such a cur (as he was). The sharpness of the sting set the ass jumping; where is the tongue (has an ass such a tongue) that he may describe his own state (feelings)? When the Súfí mounted and got going, he (the ass) began to fall on his face every time,",16
"(And) every time the people (the travellers) lifted him up: they all thought he was ill. One would twist his ears hard, while another sought for the (lacerated) part under his palate, And another searched for the stone in his shoe, and another looked at the dirt in his eye. Also they were saying,“O Shaykh, what is the cause of this? Were not you saying yesterday, ‘Thanks (to God), this ass is strong’?” He replied, “The ass that ate Lá hawl during the night cannot get along except in this manner.",16
"Inasmuch as the ass's food by night was Lá hawl, he was glorifying God by night and (is engaged) in prostrating himself by day.” Most people are man-eaters: put no trust in their saying, “Peace to you.” The hearts of all are the Devil's house: do not accept (listen to) the palaver of devilish men. He that swallows Lá hawl from the breath (mouth) of the Devil, like that ass falls headlong in the fight. Whoever swallows the Devil's imposture in this world and (swallows) veneration and deceit from the foe that has the face (semblance) of a friend,",16
"In the Way of Islam and on the bridge Sirát he will fall upon his head from giddiness, like that ass. Beware! Do not hearken to the blandishments of the bad friend: espy the snare, do not walk securely on the earth. See the hundred thousand devils who utter Lá hawl! O Adam, in the serpent behold Iblís! He gives (you) vain words, he says to you, “O my soul and beloved,” that he may strip the skin off his beloved, like a butcher. He gives vain words that he may strip off your skin: woe to him that tastes opium from (the mouth of) enemies.",16
"He lays his head at your feet (in flattery) and butcher-like gives (you) vain (wheedling) words, that he may shed your blood miserably. Like a lion, hunt your prey yourself: leave (pay no heed to) the blandishment of stranger or kinsman. Know that the regard of the base is like that servant; ’tis better to have nobody (as your friend) than (to accept) the flattery of nobodies (worthless people). Do not make your home in (other) men's land: do your own work, don't do the work of a stranger. Who is the stranger? Your earthen body, for the sake of which is (all) your sorrow.",16
"So long as you are giving your body greasy (rich) and sweet (food), you will not see fatness in your (spiritual) essence. If the body be set in the midst of musk, (yet) on the day of death its stench will become manifest. Do not put musk on your body, rub it on your heart. What is musk? The holy name of the Glorious (God). The hypocrite puts musk on his body and puts his spirit at the bottom of the ash-pit. On his tongue the name of God, and in his soul stenches (arising) from his infidel thought.",16
"In relation to him praise of God is (like) the herbage of the ash-pit: it is roses and lilies (growing) upon a dunghill. Those plants are certainly there on loan (and belong to somewhere else); the proper place for those flowers is the symposium and (the scene of) festivity. The good women come to the good men; there is (also the text) to the wicked men the wicked women. Mark! Do not bear malice: they that are led astray by malice, their graves are placed beside the malicious. The origin of malice is Hell, and your malice is a part of that whole and is the enemy of your religion.",16
"Since you are a part of Hell, take care! The part gravitates towards its whole. He that is bitter will assuredly be attached to those who are bitter: how should vain breath (false words) be joined with the truth? O brother, you are that same thought (of yours); as for the rest (of you), you are (only) bone and fibre. If your thought is a rose, you are a rose-garden; and if it is a thorn, you are fuel for the bath-stove. If you are rose-water, you are sprinkled on head and bosom; and if you are (stinking) like urine, you are cast out.",16
"Look at the trays in front of druggists—each kind put beside its own kind, Things of each sort mixed with things of the same sort, and a certain elegance produced by this homogeneity; If his (the druggist's) aloes-wood and sugar get mixed, he picks them out from each other, piece by piece. The trays were broken and the souls were spilled: good and evil ones were mingled with each other. God sent the prophets with scrolls (of Revelation), that He might pick out (and sort) these grains on the dish.",16
"Before this we were one community, none knew whether we were good or bad. False coin and fine (both) were current in the world, since all was night, and we were as night-travellers, Until the sun of the prophets rose and said, “Begone, O alloy! Come, O thou that art pure!” The eye can distinguish colours, the eye knows ruby and (common) stone. The eye knows the jewel and the rubbish; hence bits of rubbish sting the eye.",16
"These vile counterfeiters are enemies of day, those pieces of gold from the mine are lovers of day, Because day is the mirror that makes it (the fine gold) known, so that the ashrafí (the coin of sterling gold) may see (receive) its (day's) gift of honour. Hence God bestowed the title of “Day” on the Resurrection, (for) day displays the beauty of red and yellow. In reality, then, day is the inmost consciousness of the saints, (though) beside their moon day is (dim) as shadows. Know that day is the reflexion of the mystery (the illumined consciousness) of the man of God, while eye-sealing night is the reflexion of his occultation.",16
"For that reason God said, By the morn: by the morn is (refers to) the light of the hidden mind of Mustafá (Mohammed). The other view, that the Beloved (God) meant this morn (in the literal sense), is (held) just for the reason that this too is the reflexion of him; Else it is wrong to swear by a transient thing: how indeed is transiency proper to the speech of God? That Friend (Abraham) said, “I love not them that set”: how should the glorious Lord mean transiency by this (oath)? Again, and by the night is (refers to) his occultation and his earthen rust-dark body.",16
"When his sun rose from that sky, it said to the night of the body, “Lo, He hath not forsaken thee.” Union was made manifest out of the essence of affliction: that sweetness (of union) was expressed by (the words) He hath not hated (thee). In fact, every expression is the symbol of a state: the state is as a hand, while the expression is a tool. The goldsmith's tool in the hand of a shoemaker is like a seed sown in sand; And the cobbler's tool (put) before the husbandman is (as) straw before a dog (or) bones before an ass.",16
"“I am God” on the lips of Mansúr was the light (of truth); “I am Allah” on the lips of Pharaoh was a lie. In the hand of Moses the rod became a witness (to the truth); in the hand of the magician the rod became (worthless as) motes in the air. On this account Jesus did not teach his fellow-traveller that Name of the Lord, For he would not know (its proper use) and would attribute imperfection to the tool (which he misused). Strike stone on clay, and how should fire leap forth? Hand and tool are as stone and iron; there must be a pair: (the existence of) a pair is the condition (necessary) for bringing to birth.",16
"The One is He who hath no consort and no tool; in number there is doubt, and that One is beyond doubt. Those who say “two” or “three” or more than these (numbers) are certainly agreed in (affirming the existence of) One. When squinting has been put aside (so that they see correctly), they become alike: the assertors of two or three become assertors of Unity. If you are a ball in His polo-field, keep spinning round from (the blows of) His polostick. The ball becomes right and flawless (only) at the time when it is made to dance by the stroke of the King's hand.",16
"Give ear heedfully to these (sayings), O squinting one: apply the eye-salve by way of the ear. Holy words, then, do not abide in blind hearts, (but) go to the Light whence they came, While the (guileful) spell of the Devil goes into crooked (perverse) hearts as a crooked shoe on to a crooked foot. Though you may learn Wisdom by rote, it becomes quit of you when you are unworthy (to receive it); And though you write it and note it (down), and though you brag (about it) and expound it,",16
"It withdraws its face from you, O disputatious one: it snaps its bonds and (takes) flight from you. (But) if you read not and it sees your ardour (of love), Knowledge will be a bird docile (and obedient) to your hand. It does not abide with every unskilled tiro: (it is) like a peacock (which does not stay) in the house of a peasant.How the King found his falcon in the house of a decrepit old woman. It is not like the falcon that fled from the King to the old crone who was sifting flour That she might cook tutmáj for her children. (When) she saw the beautiful well-born falcon,",16
"She tied its little foot and clipped its wings; she cut its talons and fed it with straw. “Unworthy folk,” said she, “have not kept thee in (good) trim: thy wings are overgrown and thy talons have become long. Every unworthy one's hand makes thee ill: come to thy mother that she may take care of thee.” Know, O friend, that such is the affection of the fool: the fool ever walks crookedly on the way. The King's day became late (far-spent) in searching (for the falcon): he went (at last) to the old woman and the tent (where she lived).",16
"Suddenly he espied the falcon amidst smoke and dust: the King wept sorely over it and made lament. He said, “Albeit this is the retribution for thy deed, in that thou art not firm in keeping faith with me, (Yet) how shouldst thou make Hell thy abode after Paradise, heedless of (the text) the people of the Fire (and those of Paradise) are not equal? This is the fitting reward for one that unconscionably flees from the King who knows (him) well to the house of an old hag.” (Meanwhile) the falcon was rubbing its wings against the King's hand: without tongue it was saying, “I have sinned.”",16
"Where then should the vile (sinner) plead piteously, where should he moan, if Thou wilt accept naught but good, O bountiful (King)? The King's grace makes the soul sin-seeking, because the King makes every foul thing fair. Go, do not commit foulness, for (even) our fair deeds appear foul in the sight of our beauteous (Loved One). You deemed your service worthy: thereby you raised the banner of sin. Forasmuch as praise and prayer were vouchsafed to you, through making that prayer your heart became vainglorious.",16
"You regarded yourself as speaking (confidentially) with God. Oh, (there is) many a one that becomes separated (from God) by this opinion. Although the King sit with you on the ground, know yourself and sit better (with more decorum and reverence). The falcon said, “O King, I am penitent, I am converted, I am embracing Islam anew. He whom Thou makest drunken and pot-valiant—if from drunkenness he walk crookedly, do Thou accept his excuse. Though my talons are gone, when thou art mine I tear off the forelock of the sun;",16
"And though my wings are gone, when Thou art kind to me the heavenly sphere lessens its play (slackens the speed of its revolution in amazement) at my play (swift and sportive flight). If Thou bestow a belt on me, I will uproot the mountain; if Thou give me a pen, I will break the banners. After all, my body is not inferior to (that of) a gnat: with my wings I confound the kingdom of Nimrod. Suppose me to be (as) the flocks of (small) birds in weakness, suppose every one of my enemies to be as the elephant, (Yet if) I cast a baked (clay) pellet the size of a hazelnut, my pellet in its effect is like (equal to) a hundred mangonels (ballistas).”",16
"Moses came to battle with his one rod and made an onset against Pharaoh and (all) his swords. Every Prophet who by himself has knocked at that door (and besought God to help him) has alone (single-handed) fought (victoriously) against the whole world.When Noah begged of Him (God) a sword, through Him (at His command) the waves of the Flood became of sword-like temper. O Ahmad (Mohammed), who (what) indeed are the armies of the earth? Behold the moon in heaven (and) split her brow, In order that the ignorant astronomer may know that this cycle is thy cycle, not the cycle of the moon.",16
"It is thy cycle, because (even) Moses, he who spoke (with God), was constantly yearning after this cycle of thine. When Moses beheld the splendour of thy cycle, in which the dawn of Revelation was arising, He said, “O Lord, what cycle of mercy is that? It is beyond mercy: there (in that cycle) is vision (of Thee). Plunge Thy Moses in the seas (of Time) and bring him up (to the surface) from the midst of the cycle of Ahmad (Mohammed).” God said, “O Moses, on that account I have shown (it) to thee; on that account I have opened to thee the way to that (spiritual) communion (with Mohammed),",16
"Because in this (present) cycle, O Kalím, thou art far from that (cycle of Mohammed and canst not attain to it): draw back thy foot, for this blanket is (too) long (for thee). I am kind, I show My servant bread in order that desire (for it) may cause that living one to weep. A mother rubs the nose of her babe, that it may wake and seek some food— For it may have fallen asleep hungry unawares; and (on waking) it prods her two breasts for the sake of (getting) milk. I was a treasure, a hidden mercy, so I sent forth a rightly guided Imám.”",16
"Every (Divine) grace that you are seeking with (all) your soul, He showed it to you that you might desire it. How many idols did Ahmad (Mohammed) break in the world, that the (religious) communities might cry “O Lord”! Had it not been for the efforts of Ahmad, you also, like your ancestors, would be worshipping idols. This head of yours has been delivered from bowing to idols, in order that you may acknowledge his rightful claim upon the (gratitude of the religious) communities. If you speak, speak thanks for this deliverance, that he may also deliver you from the idol within.",16
"Since he has delivered your head from idols, do you deliver your heart also by means of that strength (which you have gained from him). You have neglected to give thanks for the Religion because you got it for nothing as an inheritance from your father. How should a man who inherits know the value of wealth? A Rustam tore his soul (suffered agonies in acquiring it), (whereas) Zál got it cost-free. “When I cause (any one) to weep, My mercy is aroused: that wailer drinks of (enjoys) My bounty. If I do not wish to give, (then) indeed I do not show him (the desired gift), (but) when I have closed (contracted) his heart (with grief), I open (expand) it (with joy).",16
"My mercy is dependent on that goodly weeping: when he weeps, waves rise from the sea of (My) mercy.” How by Divine inspiration Shaykh Ahmad son of Khizrúya, may God sanctify his revered spirit, bought halwá (sweetmeat)for his creditors. There was a Shaykh who was continually in debt because of the generosity which that illustrious one had (in his nature). He used to make myriads of debts (by borrowing) from the great, and spend (all the money) upon the poor (dervishes) of the world.He had also built a monastery (for Súfís) by (running into) debt; he had devoted life and wealth and monastery (to God). God was paying his debts from every quarter: God made flour out of sand for the Friend's (Abraham's) sake.",16
"The prophet said that two angels are (always) praying here in the markets, (saying), “O God, do Thou give the prodigal a boon in return, and O God do Thou give the miserly a bane (in return).” Especially (does this apply to) the prodigal who has freely spent his soul (life) and made his throat a sacrifice to the Creator. He offers his throat, like Ismá‘íl (Ishmael): the knife cannot do anything to (hurt) his throat. On this account, then, the martyrs are living in joy: do not, infidel-like, look at the body (alone),",16
"Since God hath given them in return the spirit of everlastingness—a spirit safe from grief and pain and misery. The debtor Shaykh acted in this fashion for years, taking and giving like a steward. He was sowing seeds till the day of death, that on the day of death he might be a most glorious prince. When the Shaykh's life reached its end and he saw in his (bodily) existence the signs of death, The creditors were seated together around him, (while) the Shaykh was gently melting on himself, like a candle.",16
"The creditors had become despairing and sour-faced: the pain in (their) hearts was accompanied by pain in (their) lungs. “Look at these evil-thinking men,” said the Shaykh. “Hath not God four hundred gold dinars?” A boy outside shouted “Halwá!” and bragged of (the excellence of) the halwá in hope of (getting) some dángs. The Shaykh with (a nod of) his head directed the famulus to go and buy the whole of the halwá, (Saying to himself), “so that the creditors, when they eat the halwá, for a (short) while may not look bitterly on me.”",16
"The famulus at once went out through the doorway to buy with gold the halwá entire. He said to the boy, “How much is the halwá in the lump?” The boy said, “Half a dinar and some small change.” “Nay,” he replied; “don't ask too much from Súfís: I will give you half a dinar. Say no more.” The boy put the tray before the Shaykh. Behold (now) the mysterious secret thoughts of the Shaykh! He made a sign to the creditors (as though to say), “Look, this gift (of sweetmeat) is a present (to you): eat this gladly, it is lawful (food).”",16
"When the tray was emptied, the boy took it and said, “Give me the gold, O Sage.” The Shaykh said, “From where shall I get the money? I am in debt and going towards non-existence.” The boy in (his) grief dashed the tray upon the ground; he raised (his voice in) lamentation and weeping and moaning. The boy was weeping with loud sobs because of the swindle, (and crying), “Would that both my legs had been broken (ere I came hither)! Would that I had loitered round the bath-stove and had not passed by the door of this monastery!",16
"Lickspittle gluttonous Súfís, dogs at heart and washing their faces like cats!” At the boy's clamour all and sundry gathered there and crowded round the boy. He came to the Shaykh and said, “O cruel Shaykh, know for sure that my master will kill me (with blows). If I go (back) to him empty-handed, he will kill me: wilt thou give (him) leave (to do that)?” And those creditors too turned to the Shaykh with disbelief and denial, saying, “What game was this? ",16
"Thou hast devoured our property and art carrying off thy iniquities (to the next world): for what reason was this other injustice (put) on the top (of all the rest)?” Till afternoon prayers the boy wept; the Shaykh closed his eyes and did not look at him. The Shakyh, unconcerned with abuse and opposition, had withdrawn his moon-like face under the coverlet, Pleased with eternity, pleased with death, joyous, unconcerned with revilement and the talk of high or low. He in whose face the Beloved smiles sweetly, what harm can befall him from the sour looks of (other) people?",16
"He on whose eye the Beloved bestows a kiss, how should he grieve at Heaven and its anger? On a moonlight night what cares the moon in (the mansion of) Simák for dogs and their barking? The dog is performing his task; the moon is smoothly fulfilling her task by means of her (bright) countenance. Every one is executing his little business: water does not lose purity because of a bit of weed (rubbish). The weeds float weedily (contemptibly) on the surface of the water: the pure water flows on undisturbed.",16
"Mustafá (Mohammed) splits the moon at midnight; Abú Lahab from hatred talks drivel. The Messiah (Jesus) brings the dead to life, and the Jew tears his moustache in wrath. Does the dog's bark ever reach the moon's ear, especially that Moon who is the chosen of God? The king drinks wine on the bank of the stream till dawn, and in listening to the music is unaware of the croaking of the frogs. The division of (the money due to) the boy (amongst the creditors) would have been (only a few dángs (for each to pay); (but) the Shaykh's (spiritual) influence stopped that generosity,",16
"So that no one should give the boy anything: the power of the Pírs is even greater than this. (When) it was (time for) afternoon prayers, a servant came with a tray in his hand from one like Hátim, A man of property and condition: he sent it as a present to the Pír (Shaykh), for he knew about him. (There were) four hundred dinars, and in a corner of the tray another half-dinar in a piece of paper. The servant advanced and did honour to the Shaykh, and laid the tray before the peerless Shaykh.",16
"When he (the Shaykh) uncovered the face of the tray, the people beheld the miracle (manifested) from him. Immediately cries of sorrow and lamentation arose from all —“O head of the Shaykhs and (spiritual) kings, what was (the meaning of) this? What secret is this? Once more, what sovereignty is this, O lord of the lords of mystery? We knew not. Pardon us. Very deranged were the words that went out from us. We who blindly brandish staffs cannot help breaking lamps.",16
"We, like deaf men, without having heard a single thing spoken (to us), are answering idly from our own surmise. We have not taken warning from Moses, who was made shamefaced by disbelief in a Khizr, Notwithstanding (that he had) an eye that sped aloft, and the light of his eye was piercing heaven. O Moses (of this age), through foolishness the eye of a mill-mouse has fanatically set itself against thine eye.” The Shaykh said, “I forgive all that talk and palaver: it is lawful to you.",16
"The secret of this (matter) was that I besought God: consequently He showed me the right way, And said, ‘Though that dinar is little, yet (the payment of) it is dependent on the boy's outcry.Until the halwá-selling boy weeps, the sea of (My) mercy is not aroused’.” O brother, the child (boy) is the child (pupil) of your eye: know surely that (the gaining of) your desire is dependent on (tears of) distress. If you wish that that robe of honour (which you desire) should come (to you), then make the child (pupil) of your eye weep over your body. How a certain person frightened an ascetic, saying, “Weep little, lest thou become blind.”",16
"A comrade in the work (of religion) said to an ascetic, “Weep little, lest thine eye come to harm.” The ascetic said, “The case is not outside of (admits only) two (alternatives): the eye will see, or it will not see, that (Divine) Beauty. If it see the Light of God, what is there to grieve about? How little are two eyes (to him that is) in union with God! And if it shall not see God, let it go! Let such a miserable eye become blind!” Do not grieve for your eye when that Jesus is yours; do not go to the left (but to the right), that he may give you two right (sound) eyes.",16
"The Jesus of your spirit is present with you: beg aid from him, for he is a goodly aider; But do not every moment lay on the heart of (that) Jesus the unprofitable work of (providing for) a body full of bones, Like the fool whom we mentioned in the story for the sake of the righteous. Seek not you from your Jesus the life of the body, ask not from your Moses the wish of a Pharaoh. Burden not your heart with thoughts of livelihood; livelihood will not fail: be (constant in attendance) at the (Divine) Court.",16
"This body is a tent for the spirit, or like an ark for Noah. When the Turcoman is there, he will find a tent, especially when he is one held in honour at the Court (of God). Conclusion of the story of the coming to life of the bones at the prayer of Jesus, on whom be peace! Jesus pronounced the Name of God over the bones on account of the young man’s entreaty. For the sake of that foolish man the decree of God gave life to the form which those bones had possessed. A black lion sprang forth, smote once with its paw, and destroyed his (bodily) image.",16
"It tore up his skull: his brain was scattered on the spot-the brain (kernel) of a nut, for in him was no brain. If he had had a brain, his being broken to pieces would have been no injury at all except to his body. Jesus said (to the lion), “How did you maul him so quickly?” The lion said, “Because thou wert troubled by him.” Jesus asked, “How did not you drink the man’s blood?” “In the (Divine) dispensation ‘twas not granted to me to drink (it),” replied the lion. Oh, many a one that like that raging lion has departed from the world without having eaten his prey!",16
"His (ordained portion is not (even) a straw, while his greed is as (great as) a mountain; he hat no means (of satisfying his desires), though he has gotten the (material) means. O Thou who hast made it easy for us to do unrewarded and fruitless labour in the world, deliver us! To us it seems a (tempting) bait and ‘tis (really) a hook: show it to us even as it is. The lion said, “O Messiah, (my killing) this prey was merely for the purpose that warning might be taken (by others). Had there (still) been for me in the world an allotted portion (of food), what business indeed should I have had with the dead?”",16
"This is the punishment deserved by him that finds pure water, and like an ass stales impertinently in the stream. If the ass know the value of the stream, instead of his foot he will pull his head in it. He (the fool) finds a prophet like that, a lord of the (life-giving) Water, a cherisher of life: How does not he die before him, saying, “O lord of the Water, make me living by the command ‘Be’? Take heed! Do not wish your currish (fleshy) soul alive, for it is the enemy of your spirit since long ago.",16
"Dust be on the head of the bones that hinder this cur from hunting the spirit! (If) you are not a cur, how are you in love with bones? Why are you in love with blood, like a leech? What (sort of) eye is that that hath no sight, and gets nothing but disgrace from the tests (to which it is put)? Opinions are sometimes erroneous, (but) what (sort of) opinion is this that is blind to the (right) road? O eye, thou makest lament for others: sit down awhile and weep for thyself!",16
"The bough is made green and fresh by the weeping cloud, for the (same) reason that the candle is made brighter by (its) weeping. Wheresoever people are lamenting, sit you there (and lament), because you have a better right to moan (than they have), Inasmuch as they are (concerned) with parting from that which passes away, and are forgetful of the ruby of everlasting-ness that belongs to the mine (of Reality); Inasmuch as the stamp of blind imitation is (as) a lock upon the heart;-go, scrape off (dissolve) its lock with tears-; Inasmuch as imitation is the bane of every good quality; imitation is (but) a straw, (even) if it is a mighty mountain.",16
"If a blind man is big and choleric, deem him (only) a piece of flesh, since he has no eye (eye-sight). Though he (the blind imitator) speak words finer than a hair, his heart has no knowledge of these words. He has a certain intoxication from his own words, but there is a good way (distance) between him and the Wine. He is like a river-bed: it does not drink any water; the water passes through it to the water-drinkers. The water does not settle in the river-bed because the river-bed is not thirsty and water-drinking.",16
"Like a reed-flute, he makes a piteous lament, but he (only) seeks a purchaser (admirer). The imitator in his discourse is (like) a professional mourner: that wicked man has no motive except cupidity. The professional mourner utters burning words (of grief), but where is the glow of heart (heartfelt sorrow) and the rent skirt? Between the true knower and the blind imitator there are (great) differences, for the former is like David, while the other is (but) an echo. The source of the former’s words is a glow (of feeling), whereas the imitator is one who learns old things (by rote).",16
"Beware! Be not duped by those sorrowful words” the ox bears the load, but it is the cart that moans (creaks). Even the imitator is not disappointed of the (Divine) recompense: the professional mourner gets his wages at the (time of) reckoning. (Both) infidel and true believer say “God,” but there is a good difference between the two. The beggar says “God” for the sake of bread; the devout man says “God” from his soul. If the beggar distinguished (God as He really is) from his own saying (the name of God), neither less nor more would remain before his eye. ",16
"For years that bread-seeker says “god”; like the ass, he carries the Qur’an for the sake of (being fed with) straw. Had the word on his lips shone forth in his heart, his body would have been shivered to atoms. In sorcery the name of a demon finds the way (to success); you are earning a petty coin by means of the Name of God. How a peasant stroked a lion in the dark, because he thought it was his ox. A peasant tied an ox in the stable: a lion ate his ox and sat in its place. The peasant went into the stable to (see) the ox: the man, groping into corners, was seeking the ox at night.",16
"He was rubbing his hand on the limbs of the lion, back and side, now above, now below. The lion said, “If the light were to become greater, his gall-bladder would burst and his heart would turn to blood. He is stroking me like this so boldly because in this (dark) night he thinks I am the ox.” God is saying, “O blind dupe, did not Túr (Sinai) fall in pieces at My Name? For if We had sent down (revealed) a Book to the mountain, it would have been riven asunder, then cut to pieces, and then it would have departed (disappeared).",16
"If Mount Uhud had been acquainted with Me, blood would have gushed in jets from the mountain.” You have heard this from your father and mother; in consequence you have embraced it thoughtlessly. If you become acquainted with Him without blind imitation, by (His) grace you will become immaterial, like a voice from Heaven. Hear this (following) story as a deterrent, in order that you may know the banefulness of blind imitation. How the Súfís sold the traveller's beast (to pay) for the (expenses of the) mystic dance. A Súfí, after journeying, arrived at a monastery (for Súfís); he took his mount and led it to the stable.",16
"With his own hand he gave it a little water and some fodder: (he was) not such a Súfí as the one we told of before. He took precaution for it against neglect and craziness, (but) when the (Divine) destiny comes to pass, of what avail is precaution? The Súfís were destitute and poor: poverty almost comprises an infidelity that brings (the soul) to perdition. O thou rich man who art full fed, beware of laughing at the unrighteousness of the suffering poor. On account of their destitution that Súfí flock, all of them, adopted (the expedient of) selling the ass,",16
"Saying, “(In case) of necessity a carcase is lawful (food); (there is) many a vicious act that necessity made a virtuous one.” They instantly sold the little ass; they fetched dainty viands and lit candles. Jubilation arose in the monastery: (they cried), “To-night there are dainties and music and dancing and voracity. How much (more) of this (carrying the) wallet and this beggary? How much (more) of this patience and of this three-day fasting? We also are of (God's) creatures, we have soul. Good luck (is ours) to-night: we have the guest (to entertain).” ",16
"Thereby they were sowing the seed of falsehood, for they deemed soul that which is not soul. And the traveller, too, was tired by the long journey and (gladly) saw that favour and fondness (with which they regarded him). The Súfís, one by one, caressed him: they were playing the game of (bestowing) pleasant attentions (on him). When he saw their affection towards him, he said, “If I don't make merry to-night, when (shall I do so)?” They ate the viands and began the samá‘ (musical dance); the monastery was filled with smoke and dust up to the roof—",16
"The smoke of the kitchen, the dust of (raised by) beating the feet (dancing), the tumult of soul (caused) by longing and ecstasy. Now, waving their hands, they would beat (the ground with) their feet; now, in (religious) prostration, they would sweep the dais (with their foreheads). (Only) after long (waiting) does the Súfí gain his desire (the satisfaction of his appetite) from Fortune: for that reason the Súfí is a great eater; Except, to be sure, the Súfí who has eaten his fill of the Light of God: he is free from the shame of beggary; (But) of these Súfís there are (only) a few among thousands; the rest are living in (under the protection of) his (the perfect Súfí's spiritual) empire.",16
"When the samá‘ had come (run its course) from beginning to end, the minstrel struck up a heavy (deep-sounding) strain. He commenced (to sing), “The ass is gone, and the ass is gone”; he made the whole (company) sharers in this enthusiasm. From this enthusiasm (they continued) beating their feet (dancing) till dawn, clapping their hands (and singing), “The ass is gone, the ass is gone, O son!” By way of imitation that Súfí began (to sing) in (tones of) impassioned feeling this same (phrase), “The ass is gone.” When the pleasure and excitement and music and dancing were over, day dawned and they all said, “Farewell!”",16
"The monastery was deserted, and the Súfí remained (alone): that traveller set about shaking the dust from his baggage. He brought out the baggage from his cell, in order that he might tie it on the ass, (for he was) desirous of (finding) people to travel with. He was hurrying that he might overtake his fellow-travellers; he went into the stable but did not find the ass. He said, “The servant has taken it (the ass) to water, because it drank little water last night.” The servant came, and the Súfí said to him, “Where is the ass?” “Look at your beard,” replied the servant, and a quarrel arose.",16
"He (the Súfí) said, “I have entrusted the ass to you, I have put you in charge of the ass. Discuss (the matter) with propriety, don't argue: deliver back to me what I delivered to you. I demand from you what I gave to you: return that which I sent to you. The Prophet said that whatever your hand has taken must in the end be restored (to its owner). And if you, from insolence, are not content with this, look here, let us (go) to the house of the Cadi of (our) religion.”",16
"The servant said, “I was overpowered: the Súfís rushed (on me), and I was in fear for my life. Do you throw a liver with the parts next it amongst cats, and (then) seek the trace of it? One cake of bread amongst a hundred hungry people, one wasted (starved) cat before a hundred dogs?” “I suppose,” said the Súfí, “that they took it (the ass) from you by violence, (and thereby) aimed at the life of wretched me; (And seeing this) you would not come and say to me, ‘They are taking away your ass, O poor man!’ ",16
"So that I might buy back the ass from (the purchaser) whoever he is, or else they might divide my money (amongst themselves and return the ass to me). There were a hundred ways of mending (the injury) when they (the Súfís) were present, (but) now each one is gone to a (different) clime. Whom should I seize? Whom should I take to the Cadi? ’Tis from you in sooth that this judgement has come upon me. How wouldn't you come and say (to me), ‘O stranger, such a terrible outrage has occurred’?” “By God,” said he, “I came several times to inform you of these doings,",16
"(But) you were always saying, ‘The ass is gone, O son,’ with more gusto than all (the others) who said it. (So) I was (always) going back, (thinking), ‘He himself is aware; he is satisfied with this (Divine) judgement: he is a man that knows (God)’.” The Súfí said, “They all were saying (it) merrily, (so) I also took delight in saying it. Blind imitation of them has brought me to ruin: two hundred curses be on that imitation! Especially (on) imitation of such good-for-nothing rascals— the wrath of Abraham be on them that sink!",16
"The delight of that company (of Súfís) was casting a reflexion, and this heart of mine was becoming delighted by that reflexion.” The reflexion (cast) from goodly friends is necessary until you become, without (the aid of any) reflexion, a drawer of water from the Sea. Know that the reflexion first cast is (only) imitation, (but) when it has become successive (continually recurrent) it turns into (direct) realisation (of the truth). Until it has become realisation, do not part from the friends (by whom you are guided); do not break away from the shell: the rain-drop has not (yet) become a pearl. If you wish eye and understanding and hearing to be pure, tear in pieces the curtains of selfish desire,",16
"Because the Súfí's imitation, (which arose) from desire, debarred his understanding from the light and radiance. Desire for the viands and desire for that delight (shown by the Súfís) and for the samá‘ hindered his understanding from (gaining) knowledge (of what had happened). If desire were to arise in the mirror, that mirror would be like us in (respect of) hypocrisy. If the balance had desire for riches, how would the balance give a true description of the case? Every prophet has said in sincerity to his people, “I ask not from you the wages for my message.",16
"I am (only) a guide; God is your purchaser: God has appointed me to act as broker on both sides. What are the wages for my work? The sight of the Friend (God), even though Abú Bakr give me forty thousand (dirhems). My wages are not his forty thousand (dirhems): how should glass beads be like the pearls of Aden?” I will tell you a story: listen to it attentively, that you may know that selfish desire is a plug in the ear. Whosoever hath (such) desire becomes a stammerer (morally confused); with desire (present), how should the (spiritual) eye and the heart become bright?",16
"The fancy of power and wealth before his eye is just as a hair in the eye, Except, to be sure, (in the case of) the intoxicated (saint) who is filled with God: though you give (him) treasures (vast riches), he is free; (For) when any one enjoys vision (of God), this world becomes carrion in his eyes. But that Súfí was far removed from (spiritual) intoxication; consequently he was nightblind (purblind) in (his) greed.The man dazed by greed may hear a hundred stories, (but) not a single point comes into the ear of greed. How the criers of the Cadi advertised an insolvent round the town.",16
"There was an insolvent person without house or home, who remained in prison and pitiless bondage. He would unconscionably eat the rations of the prisoners; on account of (his) appetite he was (a burden) like Mount Qáf on the hearts of the people (in the gaol). No one had the pluck to eat a mouthful of bread, because that snatcher of portions would carry off his entire meal. Any one who is far from the feast of the Merciful (God) has the eye of a (low) beggar, though he be a sultan. He (the insolvent) had trodden virtue underfoot; the prison had become a hell on account of that robber of bread.",16
"If you flee in hope of some relief, on that side also a calamity comes to meet you. No corner is without wild beasts; there is no rest but in the place where you are alone with God. The corner (narrow cell) of this world's inevitable prison is not exempt from the charges for visitors and (the cost of) housewarming. By God, if you go into a mouse-hole, you will be afflicted by some one who has the claws of a cat. Man has fatness from (thrives on) fancy, if his fancies are beautiful;",16
"And if his fancies show anything unlovely he melts away as wax (is melted) by a fire. If amidst snakes and scorpions God keep you with the fancies of them that are (spiritually) fair, The snakes and scorpions will be friendly to you, because that fancy is the elixir which transmutes your copper (into gold). Patience is sweetened by fair fancy, since (in that case) the fancies of relief (from pain) have come before (the mind). That relief comes into the heart from faith: weakness of faith is despair and torment.",16
"Patience gains a crown from faith: where one hath no patience, he hath no faith. The Prophet said, “God has not given faith to any one in whose nature there is no patience.” That same one (who) in your eyes is like a snake is a picture (of beauty) in the eyes of another, Because in your eyes is the fancy of his being an infidel, while in the eyes of his friend is the fancy of his being a (true) believer; For both the effects (belief and unbelief) exist in this one person: now he is a fish and now a hook.",16
"Half of him is believer, half of him infidel; half of him cupidity, half of him patience (and abstinence). Your God has said, “(Some) of you (are) believing”; (and) again, “(Some) of you (are) unbelieving” (as) an old fire-worshipper. (He is) like an ox, his left half black, the other half white as the moon. Whoever sees the former half spurns (him); whoever sees the latter half seeks (after him). Joseph was like a beast of burden in the eyes of his brethren; at the same time in the eyes of a Jacob he was like a houri.",16
"Through evil fancy the (bodily) derivative eye and the original unseen eye (of the mind) regarded him (Joseph) as ugly. Know that the outward eye is the shadow of that (inward) eye: whatever that (inward) eye may see, this (outward) eye turns to that (eye). You are of where, (but) your origin is in Nowhere: shut up this shop and open that shop. Do not flee to the (world of the) six directions, because in directions there is the shashdara, and the shashdara is mate, mate.How the prisoners laid a complaint of the insolvent's high-handedness before the agent of the Cadi. The prisoners came to complain to the Cadi's agent, (who was) possessed of discernment,",17
"Saying, “Take now our salutations to the Cadi and relate (to him) the sufferings inflicted on us by this vile man; For he has remained in this prison continuously, and he is an idle gad-about, a lickspittle, and a nuisance. Like a fly, he impudently appears at every meal without invitation and without salaam. To him the food of sixty persons is nothing; he feigns himself deaf if you say to him, ‘Enough!’ No morsel reaches the (ordinary) man in prison, or if by means of a hundred contrivances he discover some food,",17
"That hell-throat at once comes forward (with) this (as) his argument, that God has said, ‘Eat ye.’ Justice, justice against such a three years' famine! May the shadow of our lord endure for ever! Either let this buffalo go from prison, or make him a regular allowance of food from a trust-fund. O thou by whom both males and females are (made) happy, do justice! Thy help is invoked and besought.” The courteous agent went to the Cadi and related the complaint to him point by point.",17
"The Cadi called him (the insolvent) from the prison into his presence, and (then) inquired (about him) from his own officers. All the complaints which that flock (of prisoners) had set forth were proved to the Cadi. The Cadi said (to him), “Get up and depart from this prison: go to the house which is your inherited property.” He replied, “My house and home consist in thy beneficence; as (in the case of) an infidel, thy prison is my Paradise. If thou wilt drive me from the prison and turn me out, verily I shall die of destitution and beggary.”",17
"(He pleaded) like the Devil, who was saying, “O Preserver, O my Lord, grant me a respite till the day of Resurrection; For I am happy (to be) in the prison of this world, in order that I may be slaying the children of mine enemy, (And), if any one have some food of faith and a single loaf as provision for the journey (to the life hereafter), I may seize it, now by plot and now by guile, so that in repentance they may raise an outcry (of lamentation); (And in order that) sometimes I may threaten them with poverty, sometimes bind their eyes with (the spell of) tress and mole.”",17
"In this prison (the world) the food of faith is scarce, and that which exists is in (danger of being caught in) the noose (of destruction) through the attack of this cur. (If) from prayer and fasting and a hundred helplessnesses (utter self-abnegations) the food of spiritual feeling come (to any one), he (the Devil) at once carries it off. I seek refuge with God from His Satan: we have perished, alas, through his overweening disobedience. He is (but) one cur, and he goes into thousands (of people): into whomsoever he goes, he (that person) becomes he (Satan). Whoever makes you cold (damps your spiritual ardour) know that he (Satan) is in him: the Devil has become hidden beneath his skin.",17
"When he finds no (bodily) form, he comes into (your) fancy, in order that that fancy may lead you into woe: Now the fancy of recreation, now of the shop; now the fancy of knowledge, and now of house and home. Beware! say at once “God help me!” again and again, not with tongue alone but from your very soul. The Cadi said, “Show plainly that you are insolvent.” “Here are the prisoners,” he replied, “as thy witnesses.” “They,” said the Cadi, “are suspect, because they are fleeing from you and weeping blood (on account of your ill-treatment of them);",17
"Also, they are suing to be delivered from you: by reason of this self-interest the testimony they give is worthless.” All the people belonging to the court of justice said, “We bear witness both to his insolvency and to his (moral) degeneracy.” Every one whom the Cadi questioned about his condition said, “My lord, wash thy hands of this insolvent.” The Cadi said, “March him round the city for all to see, (and cry), ‘This man is an insolvent and a great rogue.’ Make proclamations concerning him, street by street; beat the drum (as an advertisement) of his insolvency everywhere in open view.",17
"Let no one sell to him on credit, let no one lend him a farthing. Whosoever may bring here a claim against him for fraud, I will not put him in prison any more. His insolvency has been proven to me: he has nothing in his possession, (neither) money nor goods.” Man is in the prison of this world in order that peradventure his insolvency may be proven. Our God has also proclaimed in our Qur’án the insolvency of Iblís,",17
"Saying, “He is a swindler and insolvent and liar: do not make any partnership or (play any) game with him.” And if you do so (and) bring (vain) pretexts to him, he is insolvent: how will you get profit from him? When the trouble started, they brought on the scene the camel of a Kurd who sold firewood. The helpless Kurd made a great outcry; he also gladdened the officer (appointed to seize the camel) with (the gift of) a dáng; (But) they took away his camel from the time of forenoon until nightfall, and his lamentation was of no use.",17
"Upon the camel sat that sore famine (the insolvent), while the owner of the camel was running at its heels. They sped from quarter to quarter and from street to street, till the whole town knew him by sight. Before every bath and market-place all the people gazed on his (features and) figure. (There were) ten loud-voiced criers, Turks and Kurds and Anatolians and Arabs, (proclaiming), “This man is insolvent and has nothing: let no one lend him a single brass farthing;",17
"He does not possess a single mite, patent or latent: he is a bankrupt, a piece of falsehood, a cunning knave, an oil-bag. Beware and beware! Have no dealings with him; when he brings the ox (to sell), make fast the knot. And if ye bring this decayed fellow to judgement, I will not put a corpse in prison. He is fair-spoken and his throat is very wide; (he is clad) with a new inner garment (of plausibility) and a tattered outer garment. If he puts on that (inner) garment for the purpose of deceiving, it is borrowed in order that he may beguile the common folk.”",17
"Know, O simple man, that words of wisdom on the tongue of the unwise are (as) borrowed robes. Although a thief has put on a (fine) robe, how should he whose hand is cut off take your hand (lend you a helping hand)? When at nightfall he (the insolvent) came down from the camel, the Kurd said to him, “My abode is far (from here) and a long way off. You have ridden on my camel since early morning: I (will) let the barley go, (but I will not take) less than the cost of (some) straw.” “Why, then,” he rejoined, “have we been going round (the city) until now? Where are your wits? Is nobody at home?",17
"The (sound of the) drum (giving notice) of my insolvency reached the Seventh Heaven, and you have not heard the bad news! Your ear has been filled with foolish hope; (such) hope, then, makes (one) deaf (and) blind, my lad.” Even clods and stones heard this advertisement—“he is insolvent, he is insolvent, this scoundrel.” They (the criers) said it till nightfall, and it made no impression on the owner of the camel, because he was full of (idle) hope, full. God's seal lies upon the hearing and sight: within the veils is many a form and many a sound.",17
"He communicates to the eye that which He wills of beauty and of perfection and of amorous looks; And He communicates to the ear that which He wills of music and glad tidings and cries (of rapture). The world is full of remedies, but you have no remedy till God opens a window for you. Though you are unaware of that (remedy) just now, God will make it plain in the hour of need. The Prophet said that the glorious God has created a remedy for every pain;",17
"But of that remedy for your pain you will not see (even) the colour or scent without His command. Come, O you that seek the remedy, set your eye on non-spatiality, as the eye of one (about to be) killed (turns) towards the spirit. This (spatial) world has been produced from that which is without spatial relations, for the world has received (the relation of) place from placelessness. Turn back from existence towards non-existence, (if) you seek the Lord and belong to the Lord. This non-existence is the place of income: do not flee from it; this existence of more and less is the place of expenditure.",17
"Since God's workshop is non-existence, outside of the workshop there is (only) worthlessness. Put into our heart subtle words which may move Thee to mercy, O Gracious One! From Thee (come) both the prayer and the answer; from Thee safety, from Thee also dread. If we have spoken faultily, do Thou correct it: Thou art the Corrector, O Thou (who art the) Sultan of speech. Thou hast the alchemy whereby Thou mayst transmute it, and though it be a river of blood, mayst make it a Nile.",17
"Such alchemical operations are Thy work, such elixirs are Thy secrets. Thou didst beat water and earth together: from water and clay Thou didst mould the body of Adam. Thou gavest him (Man) lineage and wife and uncles, maternal and paternal, with a thousand thoughts and joys and griefs. Again, to some Thou hast given deliverance: Thou hast parted them from this grief and joy; Thou hast borne them away from kindred and relatives and (their own) nature, Thou hast made every fair thing foul in his (such a one's) eyes.",17
"He spurns all that is perceived by the senses, and leans for support on that which is invisible. His love is manifest and his Beloved is hidden: the Friend is outside (of the world), (but) His fascination is in the world. Give up this (belief). Loves (felt) for what is endued with form have not as their object the (outward) form or the lady's face. That which is the object of love is not the form, whether it be love for (the things of) this world or yonder world. That which you have come to love for its form—why have you abandoned it after the spirit has fled? ",17
"Its form is still there: whence (then) this satiety (disgust)? O lover, inquire who your beloved (really) is. If the beloved is that which the senses perceive, every one that has senses would be in love (with it). Inasmuch as constancy is increased by that (spiritual) love, how is constancy altered (impaired) by the (decay of the material) form? The sunbeam shone upon the wall: the wall received a borrowed splendour. Why set your heart on a piece of turf, O simple man? Seek out the source which shines perpetually.",17
"You who are in love with your intellect, deeming yourself superior to worshippers of form, That (intellect) is a beam of (Universal) Intellect (cast) on your sense-perception; regard it as borrowed gold on your copper. Beauty in humankind is like gilding; else, how did your sweetheart become (as ugly as) an old ass? She was like an angel, she became like a demon, for that loveliness in her was a borrowed (transient) thing. Little by little He (God) takes away that beauty: little by little the sapling withers.",17
"Go, recite (the text) to whom so We grant length of days, him We cause to decline. Seek the heart (spirit), set not thy heart on bones; For that beauty of the heart is the lasting beauty: its lips give to drink of the Water of Life. Truly it is both the water and the giver of drink and the drunken: all three become one when your talisman is shattered. That oneness you cannot know by reasoning. Do service (to God) and refrain from foolish gabble, O undiscerning man! Your reality is the form and that which is borrowed: you rejoice in what is relative and (secondary like) rhyme.",17
"Reality is that which seizes (enraptures) you and makes you independent of form. Reality is not that which makes blind and deaf and causes a man to be more in love with form. The portion of the blind is the fancy that increases pain; the share of the (spiritual) eye is these fancies (ideas) of dying to self (faná). The blind are a mine (full) of the letter of the Qur’án: they do not see the ass, and (only) cling to the pack-saddle. Since you have sight, go after the ass which has jumped (away from you): how long (will you persist in) stitching the saddle, O saddle-worshipper?",17
"When the ass is there, the saddle will certainly be yours: bread does not fail when you have the (vital) spirit. (On) the back of the ass is shop and wealth and gain; the pearl of your heart is the stock (which provides wealth) for a hundred bodies. Mount the ass bare-backed, O busybody: did not the Prophet ride the ass bare-backed? The Prophet rode (his beast) bare-backed; and the Prophet, it is said, journeyed on foot. The ass, your fleshly soul, has gone off; tie it to a peg. How long will it run away from work and burden, how long?",17
"It must bear the burden of patience and thanksgiving, whether for a hundred years or for thirty or twenty. None that is laden supported another's load; none reaped until he sowed something. ’Tis a raw (absurd) hope; eat not what is raw, O son: eating raw brings illness to men. (Do not say to yourself), “So-and-so suddenly found a treasure; I would like the same: neither work nor shop (for me)!” That (discovery of treasure) is Fortune's doing (a piece of luck), and moreover it is rare: one must earn a living so long as the body is able. ",17
"How does earning a livelihood prevent the (discovery of) treasure? Do not retire from work: that (treasure), indeed, is (following) behind (the work). See that you are not made captive by “if,” saying, “If I had done this or the other (thing),” For the sincere Prophet forbade (people) to say “if,” and said, “That is from hypocrisy”; For the hypocrite died in saying “if,” and from saying “if” he won nothing but remorse. Parable. A certain stranger was hastily seeking a house: a friend took him to a house in ruins.",17
"He said (to the stranger), “If this (house) had a roof, it would be a home for you beside me. Your family too would be comfortable, if it had another room in it.” “Yes,” said he, “it is nice (to be) beside friends, but my dear soul, one cannot lodge in ‘if’.” All the world are seekers of happiness, and on account of a false happiness they are in the fire. Old and young have become gold-seekers, but the common eye does not distinguish alloy from gold.",17
"The pure (gold) shot a beam on the alloy: see that you choose not the gold on the ground of (mere) opinion, without a touchstone. If you have a touchstone, choose; otherwise, go, devote yourself to him that knows (the difference). Either you must have a touchstone within your own soul, or if you know not the Way, do not go forward alone. The cry of the ghouls is the cry of an acquaintance—an acquaintance who would lure you to perdition. She (the ghoul) keeps on crying, “Hark, O caravan people! Come towards me, here is the track and the landmarks.”",17
"The ghoul mentions the name of each, saying “O so-and-so,” in order that she may make that personage one of those who sink. When he reaches the spot, he sees wolves and lions, his life lost, the road far off, and the day late. Prithee say, what is the ghoul's cry like? (It is) “I desire riches, I desire position and renown.” Prevent these voices from (entering) your heart, so that (spiritual) mysteries may be revealed. Repeat (in prayer) the name of God, drown the cry of the ghouls, close your narcissus eye to this vulture.",17
"Know the difference between the false dawn and the true, distinguish the colour of the wine from the colour of the cup, That, perchance, from the eyes which see the seven colours patience and waiting may produce a (spiritual) eye, (With which) you may behold colours other than these, and may behold pearls instead of stones. What pearl? Nay, you will become an ocean, you will become a sun traversing the sky. The Worker is hidden in the workshop: go you and in the workshop see Him plain.",17
"Inasmuch as the work has woven a veil over the Worker, you cannot see Him outside of that work. Since the workshop is the dwelling-place of the Worker, he that is outside is unaware of Him. Come, then, into the workshop, that is to say, non-existence, that you may see the work and the Worker together. As the workshop is the place of clairvoyance, then outside of the workshop there is (only) blindfold ness. The rebellious Pharaoh kept his face towards existence, consequently he was blind to His (God's) workshop.",17
"Consequently he was wishing to alter the (Divine) predestination, that he might turn back the (Divine) destiny from his door. Truly the (Divine) destiny every moment was laughing derisively under its lip at the moustache (arrogance) of that cunning plotter. He killed hundreds of thousands of innocent babes, in order that the ordainment and predestination of God might be averted. In order that the prophet Moses might not come forth, he laid on his neck (made himself responsible for) thousands of iniquities and murders. He wrought all that bloodshed, and (yet) Moses was born and was made ready for his chastisement.",17
"Had he seen the workshop of the Everlasting (God), he would have ceased to move hand or foot in plotting. Moses (lay) safe within his (Pharaoh's) house, while outside he was killing the infants in vain, Even as the sensual man who pampers his body and suspects some one else of a bitter hatred (against him), Saying, “This one is a foe, and that one is envious and an enemy,” (though) in truth his envier and enemy is that body (of his). He is like Pharaoh, and his body is his Moses: he keeps running (to and fro) outside, asking, “Where is my enemy?”",17
"His fleshly soul (is) luxuriating in the house, which is his body, (while) he gnaws his hand in rancour against some one else. How men blamed a person who killed his mother because he suspected her (of adultery). A certain man killed his mother in wrath, with blows of a dagger and also with blows of his fist. Some one said to him, “From evil nature you have not borne in mind what is due to motherhood. Hey, tell (me) why you killed your mother. What did she do? Pray, tell (me), O foul villain!” He said, “She did a deed that is a disgrace to her; I killed her because that earth (her grave) is her coverer (hides her shame).”",17
"The other said, “O honoured sir, kill that one (who was her partner in guilt).” “Then,” he replied, “I should kill a man every day. I killed her, I was saved from shedding the blood of a multitude: ’tis better that I cut her throat than the throats of (so many) people.” That mother of bad character, whose wickedness is in every quarter, is your fleshly soul. Come, kill it, for on account of that vile (creature) you are every moment assailing one who is venerable. Through it this fair world is narrow (distressful) to you, for its sake (you are at) war with God and man.",17
"(If) you have killed the fleshly soul, you are delivered from (the necessity of) excusing yourself: nobody in the world remains your enemy. If any one should raise a difficulty about my words in regard to the prophets and saints, (And should say), “Had not the prophets a killed (mortified) fleshly soul? Why, then, had they enemies and enviers?”— Give ear, O seeker of truth, and hear the answer to this difficulty (born) of doubt. Those unbelievers were (really) enemies to themselves: they were striking at themselves such blows (as they struck).",17
"An enemy is one who attempts (another's) life; he that is himself destroying his own life is not an enemy (to others). The little bat is not an enemy to the sun: it is an enemy to itself in the veil (of its own blindness). The glow of the sun kills it; how should the sun ever suffer annoyance from it? An enemy is one from whom torment proceeds, (one who) hinders the ruby from (receiving the rays of) the sun. All the infidels hinder themselves from (receiving) the rays of the prophets' (spiritual) jewel.",17
"How should (unbelieving) people veil the eyes of that peerless one (the prophet or saint)? The people have (only) blinded and distorted their own eyes. (They are) like the Indian slave who bears a grudge and kills himself to spite his master: He falls headlong from the roof of the house (in the hope) that he may have done some harm to his master. If the sick man become an enemy to the physician, or if the boy show hostility to the teacher, In truth they act as brigands against themselves: they themselves waylay their own mind and spirit.",17
"If a fuller take offence at the sun, if a fish is taking offence at the water, Just once consider whom that (anger) injures, and whose star is eclipsed by it in the end. If God create you with ugly features, take care lest you become both ugly-featured and ugly-natured; And if your shoes are ripped, do not go into stony ground; and if you have two spikes, don't become four-spiked. You are envious, saying, “I am inferior to so-and-so: he (by his superior position) is increasing my inferiority in fortune.”",17
"(But) indeed envy is another defect and fault; nay, it is worse than all inferiorities. That Devil (Satan), through the shame and disgrace of inferiority (to Adam), cast himself into a hundred damnations. Because of envy, he wished to be at the top. At the top, forsooth! Nay, (he wished) to be a blood-shedder. Abú Jahl was put to shame by Mohammed, and because of envy was raising himself to the top. His name was Abu ’l-Hakam, and he became Abú Jahl: oh, many a worthy has become unworthy because of envy.",17
"I have not seen in the world of search and seeking (trial and probation) any worthiness better than a good disposition. God made the prophets the medium (between Him and His creatures) in order that feelings of envy should be displayed in the agitation (produced by something that rankles in the mind). Inasmuch as no one was disgraced by (inferiority to) God, no one was (ever) envious of God; (But) the person whom he deemed like himself—he would bear envy against him for that reason. (Now), as the grandeur of the Prophet has become established, none feels envy (of him), since he is accepted (by all the Faithful);",17
"Therefore in every epoch (after Mohammed) a saint arises (to act as his vicegerent): the probation (of the people) lasts until the Resurrection. Whosoever has a good disposition is saved; whosoever is of frail heart is broken. That saint, then, is the living Imám who arises (in every age), whether he be a descendant of ‘Umar or of ‘Alí. He is the Mahdí (the God-guided one) and the Hádí (the Guide), O seeker of the (right) way: he is both hidden (from you) and seated before your face. He is as the Light (of Mohammed), and (Universal) Reason is his Gabriel; the saint that is lesser than he is his lamp (and receives illumination from him).",17
"That (saint) who is lesser than this lamp is our lamp-niche: the Light has gradations in degree, Because the Light of God has seven hundred veils: regard the veils of the Light as so many tiers. Behind each veil a certain class (of saints) has its place of abode: these veils of theirs are (in ascending order), rank by rank, upto the Imám. Those in the last (lowest) rank, through their weakness, (are such that) their eyes cannot endure the light in front (of them); And that front rank, from weakness of sight, cannot support the light that is more advanced.",17
"The light that is the life of the first (highest rank) is heartache and tribulation to this squinter; (But) the squintnesses, little by little, grow less, and when he passes beyond the seven hundred (veils), he becomes the Sea. The fire that does good to iron or gold—how is it good for fresh quinces and apples? The apple and quince have (only) a slight crudity: unlike iron, they want a gentle heat; But those flames are (too) gentle for the iron, for it is (eagerly) drawing to (itself) the heat of that (fiery) dragon.",17
"That iron is the dervish who bears hardship (self-mortification): under the hammer and the fire he is red and happy. He is the chamberlain of the fire (and) in immediate touch (with it): he goes into the heart of the fire without (any) link (between the fire and him). Without some screen, water and water's children get no cooking or conversation from the fire. The medium is a pot or a pan—as (the medium) for the foot in walking (is) a sock (shoe)— Or a space between, so that the air becomes burning hot and brings (the fire) to the water.",17
"The dervish, then, is he that has no intermediary: the flames have (direct) connexion with his being. Therefore he is the heart of the world, because by means of this heart the body attains to (its proper) art (function). (If) the heart be not there, how can the body talk and speak? (If) the heart seek not, how can the body seek and search? Therefore the theatre of the (Divine) rays is that iron; therefore the theatre of God is the heart, not the body. Again, these partial (individual) hearts are as the body in relation to the heart of the man of heart (the perfect saint), which is the original source.",17
"Man is concealed underneath his tongue: this tongue is the curtain over the gate of the soul. When a gust of wind has rolled up the curtain, the secret of the interior of the house is disclosed to us, (And we see) whether in that house there are pearls or (grains of) wheat, a treasure of gold or whether all is snakes and scorpions; Or whether a treasure is there and a serpent beside it, since a treasure of gold is not without some one to keep watch. Without premeditation he (that slave) would speak in such wise as others after five hundred premeditations.",18
"You would have said that in his inward part there was a sea, and that the whole sea was pearls of eloquence, (And that) the light that shone from every pearl became a criterion for distinguishing between truth and falsehood. (So) would the light of the Criterion (Universal Reason), (if it shone into our hearts), distinguish for us truth and falsehood and separate them mote by mote; The light of the (Divine) Pearl would become the light of our eyes: both the question and the answer would be (would come) from us. (But) you have made your eyes awry and seen the moon's disk double: this gazing in perplexity is like the question.",18
"Make your eyes straight in the moonshine, so that you may see the moon as one. Lo, (that is) the answer. Tell your thought not to see awry and to look well (rightly): that thought is the radiance of that Pearl. Whenever an answer comes to the heart through the ear, the eye says, “Hear it from me; let that (answer given through the ear) alone!” The ear is a go-between, while the eye is possessed of union (immediate vision); the eye has direct experience (of reality), while the ear has (only) words (doctrine). In the ear's hearing there is a transformation of qualities; in the eyes' seeing there is a transformation of essence.",18
"If your knowledge of fire has been turned to certainty by words (alone), seek to be cooked (by the fire itself), and do not abide in the certainty (of knowledge derived from others). There is no intuitive (actual) certainty until you burn; (if) you desire this certainty, sit down in the fire. When the ear is penetrating, it becomes an eye; otherwise, the word (of God) becomes entangled in the ear (and does not reach the heart). This discourse hath no end. Turn back, that (we may see) what the King did to those slaves of his. How the King sent away one of the two slaves and interrogated the other. When he saw that that laddie was possessed of keen intelligence, he made a sign to the other to come (to him).",18
"(If) I have called him by (a word which has) the suffix of pity (tenderness), ’tis not to belittle him: if a grandfather say “my sonny,” it is not (in) contempt. When the second (slave) came before the King, he had a stinking mouth and black teeth. Although the King was displeased by his speech, still he made some inquiry concerning his hidden thoughts. He said, “With this aspect and this stinking mouth, sit at a distance, but do not move too far off— For (hitherto) you have been (with regard to me in the position of) a writer of letters and notes; you have not been a companion and friend and comrade—",18
"That we may treat (and cure) that mouth of yours: you are (now) the beloved (patient), and we are the skilful physician. ’Tis not fitting to burn a new blanket on account of one flea; (nor would it become me) to shut my eyes to (turn my back on) you (because of superficial faults). Notwithstanding all (this), sit down and talk on a few topics, that I may well see the form of your mind.” Then he sent that keen-witted one away to do (his behest): (he sent him) to a bathhouse, saying, “Go, scrub yourself.” And to this other one he said, “Good! you are a clever lad: in truth you are a hundred slaves, not one.",18
"You are not such as your fellow-servant declared: that envious one would (fain) have made me cold to (disgusted with) you,(For) he said that you are thievish and dishonest and ill-behaved, immoral and infamous and so forth.” The slave said, “He (my fellow-servant) has always been veracious; I have not seen any one so truthful as he is. Veracity is inborn in his nature; whatever he says, I do not say it is void (of truth). I deem not that good-minded one malicious: I (rather) suspect my own person.",18
"Maybe, he sees in me faults I do not see in myself, O King.” Any one who saw his own faults before (seeing those of others) —how indeed should he be unconcerned with correcting himself? These people (of the world) take no heed of themselves, O father: consequently they blame one another. O idolater (dualist), (if) I do not behold my own face (reality), I behold thy face and thou beholdest mine. He that beholds his own face (reality)—his light is greater than the light of the creatures (of God).",18
"Though he die, his sight is everlasting, because his sight is the sight of the Creator. That light by which he sensibly beholds his own face (reality) before him, is not the light of sense. The King said, “Now tell his (your fellow-servant's) faults, just as he spoke of yours, That I may know whether you are solicitous for me and a (good) house-steward of my property and business.” He replied, “O King, I will tell his faults, though he is to me a pleasing fellow-servant.",18
"His faults are affection and loyalty and humanity; his faults are sincerity and keen wittedness and cordial comradeship. His least fault is generosity and bounty—the generosity that even gives up life.” God has brought to view myriads of lives (in return for the life given up): what generosity would there be (in him) that saw not those? And if he saw them, how should he grudge his life? How should he become so grieved for the sake of one life? On the river-bank, water is grudged by him (alone) that is blind to the stream of water.",18
"The Prophet said, “Whosoever knows for sure his recompense on the day of Resurrection— That his compensation will be ten for one—at every moment a different (act of) munificence will issue from him.” All munificence is from seeing compensations; therefore seeing the compensation is opposed to fearing (and shrinking from the act of munificence). Miserliness consists in not seeing compensations: the prospect of pearls keeps the diver glad. Hence no one in the world is miserly, since no one hazards anything without (seeing) what is to be received in exchange.",18
"Generosity, then, comes from the eye, not from the hand: ’tis seeing that matters; none but the seer is saved. “Another fault (of his is) that he is not self-conceited; he is anxious to find fault with his self-existence. He has (always) been one who speaks in blame of himself and seeks to blame himself; he has (always) been good (kind) to all and bad (unkind) to himself.” The King said, “Do not show (such) eagerness in praising your friend, do not introduce praise of yourself in the mask of (your) praise of him; Because I will bring him to the test, and shame will befall you in the upshot.” How the slave, from the purity of his thought, swore to the truth and loyalty of his friend.",18
"He said, “Nay, by Allah, and by the great God, the possessor of kingdom, and by the Merciful and Compassionate One; By the God who sent the prophets, not in (His) need (of them), but in grace and majesty; By the Lord who from the lowly earth created (those) glorious princely riders, (And) purified them from the temperament of earthly beings, and caused them to outrun the celestials; (By Him) who took up from the Fire and fashioned into pure Light—and then it outstripped all (the other) lights—",18
"That splendour of lightning which shone over the spirits, so that Adam gained from that Light (his) knowledge (of God). The hand of Seth gathered that which grew from Adam: therefore Adam, when he saw that (Light in him), made him his vicar. Since Noah had enjoyment of that Jewel, he showered pearls (of Divine wisdom) in the air of the Sea of Soul. From (possession of) that mighty radiance the spirit of Abraham went fearlessly into the flames of the fire. When Ismá‘íl (Ishmael) fell into the stream thereof, he laid his head before his (Abraham's) flashing knife.",18
"The soul of David was heated by its rays: iron became soft in his hand-loom. When Solomon was suckled on (the milk of) union with it, the demon became a thrall to his command and obedient. When Jacob bowed his head (in submission) to the (Divine) destiny, it (the Light) illumined (gladdened) his eye with the scent of his (lost) son. When the moon-faced Joseph beheld that Sun, he became so wide-awake (wise) in the interpretation of dreams. When the rod drank water (was imbued with the influence of the Light) from the hand of Moses, it made one mouthful of Pharaoh's empire.",18
"When Jesus, the son of Mary, found its ladder, he sped to the topmost height of the Fourth Dome (of Heaven). When Mohammed gained that Kingdom and Felicity, he in a moment clave the disk of the moon in two halves. When Abú Bakr became a signal example of (God's) favour, he became the Companion of such a King (as Mohammed) and (received the name) Siddíq. When ‘Umar became distraught with that Beloved, he became a Fárúq (discerner), like the heart, between truth and falsehood. When ‘Uthmán became the fountain of that clear (Essence), he was light overflowing and became Dhu ’l-Núrayn (Lord of the Two Lights).",18
"When at (the sight of) its countenance Murtazá (‘Alí) began to scatter pearls (of spiritual truth), he became the Lion of God in the pasture of the soul. When Junayd received that support (which he received) from its army, his maqámát (stages of progress in the mystical life) became innumerable. Báyazíd saw the way into its superabundance, and heard from God (heard God bestow upon him) the name, “Pole of the Gnostics.” When Karkhí became the guard of its city, he became the vicar of (Divine) love and inspired by the Divine breath. The son of Adham joyously rode his steed towards it, and became the supreme sovereign of justice.",18
"And that (famous) Shaqíq by cleaving (traversing) that venerable Way became a sun of (clear) judgement and keen- sighted. Hundreds of thousands of hidden (spiritual) kings are holding their heads high (in the region) beyond this world; Because of God's jealousy their names remained hidden: every beggar did not pronounce their names. By the truth of that Light and by the truth of those illumined ones who are as fishes in that Sea— ’Tis not fitting if I call it the Sea of the Soul and the Soul of the Sea: I am seeking a new name for it;— ",18
"By the truth of that That from which this and that are (derived), and in relation to which (all) kernels are as rinds, (I swear) that the (good) qualities of my fellow-servant and friend exceed my description (of them) a hundredfold. That which I know of the (spiritual) endowments of that comrade (of mine) would not be believed by thee: what shall I say, O noble (king)?” The King said, “Now speak of your own (case); how long will you speak of what concerns this or that one? What do you possess and what have you gained? What pearls have you fetched from the bottom of the Sea?",18
"On the day of death this sense-perception of yours will vanish: have you the spiritual light that should be the companion of your heart? When dust shall fill these eyes in the tomb, have you that which will make the grave bright? At the time when your hands and feet shall be torn in shreds, have you wings and plumes that your spirit may fly aloft? At the time when this animal soul is no more, it behoves you to set the everlasting spirit in its place. The stipulation of (implied in) he that comes with good (shall be rewarded tenfold) does not consist in doing (good); it consists in bringing this good to the presence of God.",18
"You have a substance (essence) human or asinine (bestial): (bring that to God): how can you bring (to Him) these accidents (of word or deed) which have passed away? As regards these accidents of prayer and fasting—since (that which) does not endure for two moments becomes naught— ’Tis impossible to carry over the accidents (into another state); but they (may) take away diseases (defects) from the substance, So that the substance becomes changed by means of this accident, as when disease is removed by abstinence. By exertion abstinence, (which is) the accident, becomes the substance: through abstinence the acrid mouth becomes (sweet as) honey.",18
"Land, through sowing, is turned into ears of corn; remedies for the hair turn the hair into chains (make it long and curly). Conjugal intercourse was the accident; it passed away, and the substance, (which is) the child, was produced from us. The mating of horse or camel is the accident; the object is the birth of the colt, (which is) the substance. Similarly, the planting of the garden is the accident; the produce of the garden became the substance—behold the object (for which the garden was planted)! Regard, also, the practice of alchemy as the accident; if a substance is produced by that alchemy, bring (it into view).",18
"Burnishing is the accident, O prince; from this accident is born the substance, purity. Do not say, then, ‘I have done deeds’; show the income (fruit) of those accidents, do not evade (my request). This attribution of qualities is (only) an accident. Be silent: do not kill for sacrifice the goat's shadow!” The slave said, “O King, the mind cannot but despair if you say that accidents are not carried over. O King, there is nothing but despair for the servant (of God), if the accident that has gone is not coming back.",18
"If there were no carrying over and resurrection of accidents, action would be vain and words (mere) babble. These accidents are carried over in another guise: the resurrection of everything mortal is another (mode of) existence. The carrying over of everything is just as befits it: what befits the herd is its drover. At the time of the Resurrection every accident has a (particular) form, and the form of every accident has a turn (of appearing before God). Look on thyself. Wert not thou an accident—the movement of copulation, and copulation with a purpose?",18
"Look on houses and edifices: they were as tales in the (mind of) the architect. Such-and-such a house, which seemed to us beautiful, of which the hall, roof, and door were well-proportioned— (’Twas) the accident (design) and ideas (proceeding) from the architect (that) brought the tools and pillars (into existence) from (their respective) handicrafts. What but some fancy and accident and idea is the origin and source of every handicraft? Look disinterestedly on all the (various) parts of the world: they are not the result of (anything) except accident.",18
"The beginning, which is thought, comes to an end in action; know that in such wise was the construction of the world in eternity. The fruits are first in the mind's thought, (but only) at the last do they become manifest actually: When you have done work (and) planted the tree—at the end (when the fruit appears) you read the first words. Although its boughs, leaves, and roots are first, (yet) all those are sent for the sake of the fruit. Hence that hidden Thought which was the brain (core) of those (nine) heavens was in the end the lord of lawlák.",18
"This discussion and talk are (involve) the carrying over of accidents; this lion and jackal are (examples of) the carrying over of accidents. Indeed, all created beings were accidents (once), so that in this sense (the text) was revealed—Did there not come…? Whence arise those accidents? From ideas. And whence arise these ideas? From thoughts. This world is one thought (emanating) from the Universal Intellect: the Intellect is like a king, and the ideas (are his) envoys. The first world is the world of probation; the second world is the (world of) recompense for this and that.",18
"Thy servant, O King, commits a sin: that accident becomes (a substance, namely) chains and prison. When thy slave performed goodly service, did not that accident become a robe of honour in the battle (between the flesh and the spirit)? This accident with the substance (belonging to it) is egg and bird: this is produced by that, and that by this, in succession.” The King said, “Take the meaning (to be) so: (why then) have these accidents of yours not produced any substance?” “(Divine) Wisdom,” replied the slave, “has kept it concealed, in order that this world of good and evil may be a mystery,",18
"Because, if the (substantial) forms of thought were to become manifest, infidel and believer (alike) would speak naught but praise (of God). Then, were this clearly seen, O King, not hidden, and were the mark of religion or infidelity (visible) on the forehead, How would there be idol and idolater in this world? How would any one have the stomach to mock (at holy things)? Then this world of ours would be (like) the Resurrection: who commits sin and wrong at the Resurrection?” The King said, “God has veiled the retribution of evil, but (only) from the vulgar, not from His own elect.",18
"If I entrap one Amír, I keep it hidden from the (other) Amírs, (but) not from the Vizier. God, then, has shown to me the retribution of work and myriads of the (substantial) forms of actions. Give a sign (outwardly), for I know all: the cloud does not veil the moon from me.” The slave said, “Then what is the object of my speaking, since thou knowest what is (the real nature of) that which has been?” The King said, “The wisdom (of God) in making the world manifest (was) that the (thing) known should come forth (to be seen) plainly. ",18
"Until He made visible that which He knew, He did not lay upon the world the pain of parturition and the throes (thereof). You cannot sit inactive for one moment: (you cannot rest) till some badness or goodness has issued from you. These demands (cravings) for action were appointed in order that your inward consciousness should come clearly into (outward) view. How, then, should the reel, which is the body, become still, when the thread's end, which is the mind, is pulling it? The sign of that pulling is your anguish: to be inactive is to you like the death-agony.",18
"This world and that world are for ever giving birth: every cause is a mother, the effect is born (from it as) a child. When the effect was born, that too became a cause, so that it might give birth to wondrous effects. These causes are generation on generation, but it needs a very well illumined eye (to see all the links in their chain).” The King, in conversation with him, arrived at this point, that he saw from him a sign (which was) not apparent. If that searching King saw (such a sign), ’tis not strange; but we are not permitted to mention it.",18
"When that (other) slave came from the warm bath, that King and lofty personage called him to his presence, (And) said, “Health (to you)! Lasting happiness be yours! You are very fine and elegant and good-looking. Oh, alas! If there were not in you that which so-and-so says about you, Whoever beheld your face would become glad; the sight of you would be worth the empire of the world.” He said, “O King, utter some hint of what that miscreant said about me.”",18
"The King said, “In the first place he described you as double-faced, saying that you are ostensibly a remedy (but) secretly a disease.” When he heard from the King the malice of his companion, at once the sea of his anger surged up. That slave foamed and reddened, so that the billows of his vituperation exceeded (all) bounds. He said, “From the first moment that he was associated with me, he was a great eater of dung, like a dog in (time of) famine.” As he satirised him moment after moment (continuously), like a bell, the King put his hand on his (the slave's) lips, saying, “Enough!”",18
"He said, “I know you from him by that (which you have spoken): in you the spirit is foul, and in your companion (only) the mouth. Therefore do you sit far off, O foul-spirited one, that he may be the commander and you under his command.” It is (said) in the Hadíth (Traditions of the Prophet): “Know, sire, that glorification (of God) from hypocrisy is like the verdure on a midden.” Know, then, that a fair and goodly form with bad qualities (within) is not worth a farthing; And though the form be despicable and unpleasing, (yet) when his (that person's) disposition is good, die at his feet!",18
"Know that the outward form passes away, (but) the world of reality remains for ever. How long will you play at loving the shape of the jug? Leave the shape of the jug; go, seek the water. You have seen its (outward) form, you are unaware of the reality; pick out from the shell a pearl, if you are wise. These shells of bodies in the world, though they all are living by (grace of) the Sea of Soul— Yet there is not a pearl in every shell: open your eyes and look into the heart of each one,",18
"And pick out what that one has and what this, because that costly pearl is seldom found. If you go (turn your attention) to the form, by external appearance a mountain is a hundred times as much as a ruby in bigness; Also, in respect of form, your hands and feet and hair are a hundred times as much as the contour of the eye; But this (fact) is not hidden from you, that the two eyes are the choicest of all (your) members. By one thought that comes into the mind a hundred worlds are overturned in a single moment.",18
"If the body of the Sultan is, in form (appearance), one (only), (yet) hundreds of thousands of soldiers run behind (it). Again, the figure and form of the excellent King are ruled by one invisible thought. Behold people without end who, moved by one thought, have gone over the earth like a flood; Small is that thought in the people's eyes, but like a flood it swallowed and swept away the world. So, when you see that from a thought every craft in the world (arises and) subsists—",18
"(That) houses and palaces and cities, mountains and plains and rivers, Earth and ocean as well as sun and sky, are living (derive their life) from it as fishes from the sea— Then why in your foolishness, O blind one, does the body seem to you a Solomon, and thought (only) as an ant? To your eye the mountain appears great: (to you) thought is like a mouse, and the mountain (like) a wolf. The (material) world in your eyes is awful and sublime: you tremble and are frightened at the clouds and the thunder and the sky,",18
"While in regard to the world of thought, O less (lower) than the ass, you are secure and indifferent as a witless stone, Because you are a (mere) shape and have no portion of intelligence; you are not of human nature, you are an ass's colt. From ignorance you deem the shadow to be the substance: hence to you the substance has become a plaything and of slight account. Wait till the Day when that thought and phantasy unfolds its wings and pinions without any veil (encumbrance). You will see that the mountains have become like soft wool, (and that) this Earth of hot and cold has become naught;",18
"You will see neither the sky nor the stars nor (any) existence but God, the One, the Living, the Loving. Here is a tale, (be it) true or false, to illustrate (these) truths. How the (King's) retainers envied the favourite slave. A King had, of his grace, preferred a certain slave above all his retinue. His allowance was the stipend of forty Amírs; a hundred Viziers would not see (receive) a tenth of its amount. Through the perfection of (his) natal star and prosperity and fortune he was an Ayáz, while the King was the Mahmúd of the time.",19
"His spirit in its origin, before (the creation of) this body, was near-related and akin to the King's spirit. (Only) that matters which has existed before the body; leave (behind you) these things which have newly sprung into being. That which matters belongs to the knower (of God), for he is not squinting: his eye is (fixed) upon the things first sown. That which was sown as wheat (good) or as barley (relatively evil)—day and night his eye is fastened on that place (where it was sown). Night gave birth to nothing but what she was pregnant withal: designs and plots are wind, (empty) wind.",19
"How should he please his heart with fair designs who sees the design of God (prevailing) over them? He (who trusts in his own devices) is laying a snare within the snare (of God): by your life, neither this (snare) will escape (destruction) nor will that (man). Though (in the meanwhile) a hundred herbs grow and fade, there will grow up at last that which God has sown. He (the cunning man) sowed new seed over the first seed; (but) this second (seed) is passing away, and (only) the first is sound (and enduring). The first seed is perfect and choice; the second seed is corrupt and rotten.",19
"Cast away this contrivance of yours before the Beloved— though your contrivance indeed is of His contriving. That which God has raised (and that alone) has use: what He has at first sown at last grows. Whatever you sow, sow for His sake, inasmuch as you are the Beloved's captive, O lover. Do not hang about the thievish fleshly soul and its work: whatsoever is not God's work is naught, naught. (Sow the good seed) ere the Day of Resurrection shall appear and the night-thief be shamed before Him whose is the Kingdom,",19
"With the goods stolen by his contrivance and craft (still) remaining on his neck at the Day of Judgement. Hundreds of thousands of minds may jump together (conspire) to lay a snare other than His snare; (But) they only find their snare more grievous (to themselves), (for) how can straws show any power (of resistance) against the wind? If you say, “What was the profit of (our created) being?” (I reply), “There is profit in your question, O contumacious one. If this question of yours has no profit, why should I listen to it in vain and fruitlessly?",19
"And if there are many profits in your question, then why, pray, is the world unprofitable? And (again), if from one standpoint the world is unprofitable, from other standpoints it is advantageous. If your profit is no profit to me, (yet) since it is a profit to you, do not withdraw from it.” The beauty of Joseph profited a (whole) world (of people), though to his brethren it was a vain superfluity. The melodies of David were so dear (to the faithful), but to the interdicted (unbeliever) they were (no more than) the noise of wood.",19
"The water of the Nile was superior to the Water of Life, but to the interdicted and unbelieving it was blood. To the true believer martyrdom is life; to the hypocrite it is death and corruption. Tell (me), what single blessing is there in the world, from which some group of people is not excluded? What profit have the ox and the ass in sugar? Every soul has a different food; But if that food is accidental to it (and not according to its real nature), then admonition is the (proper) correction for it.",19
"As (in the case of) one who from disease has become fond of (eating) clay— though he may suppose that that (clay) is indeed his (natural) food, He has (in reality) forgotten his original food and has betaken himself to the food of disease. Having given up honey, he has eaten poison; he has made the food of disease (to be his nourishment) as (though it were) fat. Man's original food is the Light of God: animal food is improper for him; But, in consequence of disease, his mind has fallen into this (delusion), that day and night he should eat of this water and clay.",19
"(He is) pale-faced, weak-footed, faint-hearted—where is the food of by Heaven which hath (starry) tracks? That is the food of the chosen ones of the (Divine) sovereignty; the eating thereof is (done) without throat or instrument. The food of the (spiritual) sun is (derived) from the light of the (celestial) Throne; (the food that belongs) to the envious and devilish is (derived) from the smoke of the (terrestrial) carpet. God said concerning the martyrs, they are (alive with their Lord) receiving sustenance. For that food there was neither mouth nor dish. The heart is eating a (particular) food from every single companion; the heart is getting a (particular) excellence from every single (piece of) knowledge.",19
"Every human being's (outer) form is like a cup; (only) the (spiritual) eye is a percipient of his (or her) reality. You eat (receive) something from meeting with any one, and you carry away something from conjunction with any associate. When planet comes into conjunction with planet, the effect appropriate to them both is assuredly produced, As (for example) the conjunction of man and woman brings to birth the human being, and (as) sparks arise from the conjunction of stone and iron; And (as) from the conjunction of earth with rains (there are produced) fruits and greenery and sweet herbs;",19
"And (as) from the conjunction of green things (plants and verdant spots) with man (there is produced) joy of heart and carelessness and happiness; And (as) from the conjunction of happiness with our souls are born our goodness and beneficence. Our bodies become capable of eating and drinking when our desire for recreation (in the open air) is satisfied. Redness of countenance is (derived) from the conjunction of blood (with the face); blood is (derived) from the beautiful rose- coloured sun. Redness is the best of (all) colours, and that is (born) of the sun and is arriving (to us) from it.",19
"Every land that has been conjoined with Saturn has become nitrous and is not the place for sowing. Through concurrence power comes into action, as (in the case of) the conjunction of the Devil with hypocrites. These spiritual truths without (possessing) any (worldly) pomp and grandeur, have pomp and grandeur from the Ninth Heaven. The pomp and grandeur belonging to (the world of) creation is a borrowed (adventitious) thing; the pomp and grandeur belonging to the (world of) Command is an essential thing. For the sake of (earthly) pomp and grandeur they endure abasement; in the hope of glory they are happy in (their) abasement.",19
"In the hope of a ten days' (transient) glory (full) of annoyance, they have made their necks, from anxiety, (thin) as a spindle. How do not they come to this place where I am?—for in this (spiritual) glory I am the shining Sun. The rising-place of the sun is the pitch-coloured tower (of heaven), (but) my Sun is beyond (all) rising-places. His “rising-place” (is only) in relation to His motes: His essence neither rose nor set. I who am left behind (surpassed in eminence) by His motes am (nevertheless) in both worlds a sun without shadow.",19
"Still, I am revolving round the Sun—’tis wonderful; the cause of this is the majesty of the Sun. The Sun is acquainted with (all secondary) causes; at the same time the cord of (all secondary) causes is severed from Him. Hundreds of thousands of times have I cut off (abandoned) hope—of whom? Of the Sun? Do you believe this? Do not believe of me that I can endure to be without the Sun, or the fish to be without water; And if I become despairing, my despair is the objective manifestation of the Sun's work, O goodly (friend). ",19
"How should the objective manifestation of the work be cut off from the very self of the Worker? How should any object of (contingent) being pasture on (derive existence from) aught but (Absolute) Being? All (contingent) beings pasture on this Meadow, whether they be Buráq or Arab horses or even asses; And he that has not regarded (all) becomings (movements and changes) as (proceeding) from that Sea, at every instant turns his face towards a new point of orientation. He has drunk salt water from the sweet Sea, so that the salt water has made him blind. The Sea is saying, “Drink of my water with the right hand, O blind one, that thou mayst gain sight.”",19
"Here “the right hand” is right opinion, which knows concerning (both) good and evil whence they are. O lance, there is a Lancer, so that sometimes thou becomest straight, sometimes (bent) double. Through love of Shams-i Dín (the Sun of the Religion) I am without claws (powerless); else would not I make this blind one see? Hark, O Light of the Truth, Husámu’ddín, do thou speedily heal him, to the confusion of the eye of the envious; (Heal him with) the quick-acting tutty of majesty, the darkness-killing remedy of the recalcitrant,",19
"Which, if it strike on the eye of the blind man, will dispel from him a hundred years' darkness. Heal all the blind ones except the envious man who from envy is bringing denial against thee. To thy envier, though it be I, do not give life, (but let me alone) so that I may be suffering the agony of (spiritual) death even as he is. (I mean) him that is envious of the Sun and him that is fretting at the existence of the Sun. Look you, this is the incurable disease which he has, alas; look you, this is one fallen for ever to the bottom of the pit.",19
"What he wants is the extinction of the Sun of eternity. Tell (me), how should this desire of his come to pass? The falcon (seeker of God) is he that comes back to the King; he that has lost the way is the blind falcon. It lost the way and fell into the wilderness; then in the wilderness it fell amongst owls. It (the falcon) is wholly light (derived) from the Light of (Divine) approval, but the marshal, Fate, blinded it. He threw dust in its eyes and took it (far) away from the (right) road; he left it amidst owls and (in) the wilderness.",19
"To crown all, the owls attack it and tear its lovely wing-feathers and plumes. A clamour arose amongst the owls—“Ha! the falcon has come to seize our dwelling place.” (’Twas) as (when) the street-dogs, wrathful and terrifying, have fallen upon the frock of a (dervish) stranger. “How am I fit,” says the falcon, “for (consorting with) owls? I give up to the owls a hundred wildernesses like this. I do not wish to stay here, I am going, I will return to the King of kings.",19
"Do not kill yourselves (with agitation), O owls, for I am not settling (here): I am going home. This ruin is a thriving abode in your eyes; for me, however, the King's fore-arm is the place whither one returns.” The owl (that was warning the others) said, “The falcon is plotting to uproot you from house and home. He will seize our houses by cunning, he will tear us out of our nests by (his) hypocrisy. This devotee of guile pretends to be perfectly satisfied (with what he has); by God, he is worse than all the greedy together.",19
"From greediness he eats clay as (if it were) date-syrup: O friends, do not entrust the sheep's tail to the bear.He is boasting of the King and the King's hand, in order that he may lead us astray, simple-minded as we are. How, indeed, should a petty bird be the congener of the King? Do not listen to him, if you have (even) a little understanding. Is he the King's or the Vizier's congener? Is garlic at all suitable to sweetmeat made with walnut kernels? (As for) his saying, from deceit and feint and artifice, ‘The King with his retinue is searching after me,’",19
"Here's an absurd mad fancy for you, here's a vain boast and a snare to catch blockheads! Any one who believes this—’tis because of (his) foolishness: how is a slender little bird fit for (friendship with) royalty? If the smallest owl should strike at his brain, where is succour for him from the King?” The falcon said, “If a single feather of mine be broken, the King of kings will uproot the (whole) owlery. What is an owl? Even if a falcon vex my heart and maltreat me,",19
"The King will heap up in every lowland and highland hundreds of thousands of stacks of falcons' heads. His favours keep watch over me; wherever I go, the King is (following) behind. The phantasy of me is abiding in the King's heart: sick (would be) the King's heart without the phantasy of me. When the King bids me fly in His Way I fly up to the heart's zenith, like His beams. I fly as a moon and sun, I rend the curtains of the skies.",19
"The light of intellects is from my thought; the bursting forth of heaven (into existence) is from my original nature. I am a falcon, and (yet) the humá becomes lost in amazement at me: who is an owl, that it should know my secret? For my sake the King bethought him of the prison (this world), and set free hundreds of thousands of those in bondage. He made me familiar with the owls for a moment, and by means of my breath (words) he made the owls (to be) falcons. Oh, happy (is) the owl that in my (soaring) flight (towards God) had the good fortune to apprehend my mystery.",19
"Cling to me, that ye may become exultant (enjoying bliss), (and that) ye may become royal falcons, although ye are owls. He that is dear to such a King—wheresoever he light, why should he be a stranger? Any one for whose pain the King is the remedy—though he wail like the reed (flute), he is not without plenty. I am the owner of the (spiritual) kingdom, I am not a lickspittle: the King is beating the falcon-drum for me from the shore. My falcon-drum is the call, ‘Return!’ God is my witness in despite of adversary.",19
"I am not a congener of the King of kings—far be it from Him!—but I have light from Him in (His) self-manifestation. Homogeneity is not in respect of form and essence: water becomes homogeneous with earth in the plant. Wind (air) becomes homogeneous with fire in consistency; wine at last becomes homogeneous with the constitution (of the body). Since my genus is not the genus of my King, my ego has passed away (faná) for the sake of His ego. Inasmuch as my ego passed away, He remained alone: I roll at the feet of His horse, like dust.",19
"The (individual) soul (self) became dust, and the (only) signs of it are the mark of His feet on its dust. Become dust at His feet for the sake of this mark, in order that you may become the crown on the head of the lofty. Let not my form beguile you: partake of my dessert before my departure.” Oh, (there is) many a one whom the form waylaid: he aimed at the form (of the holy man) and (in reality) struck at God. After all, this soul is joined to the body, (but) has this soul any likeness to the body? ",19
"The sparkle of the eye's light is paired with the fat; the light of the heart is hidden in a drop of blood; Joy (has its seat) in the kidneys, grief in the liver; intellect, (bright) as a candle, inside the brain in the head. These connexions are not without a how and a why, (but) as regards knowledge of the why (our) minds are impotent. The Universal Soul came into contact with the partial (individual) soul, and the (latter) soul received from it a pearl and put it into its bosom. Through that touch on its bosom the (individual) soul became pregnant, like Mary, with a heart-beguiling Messiah,",19
"Not the Messiah who is (a traveller) on land and water, (but) the Messiah who is beyond (the limitation of) measuring (space). So when the soul has been impregnated by the Soul of soul, by such a soul the world is impregnated. Then the world gives birth to another world, and displays to this congregated people a place of congregation (for the realities which are raised to life). Though I should speak and recount till the Resurrection, I lack the power to describe this (spiritual) resurrection. These sayings (of mine), indeed, are really an “O Lord” (a prayer addressed to God); the words are the lure for the breath of a sweet-lipped One.",19
"Like words spoken by a sweet and delicious friend: the noise of the water made him drunken as (though it were) wine. From the pleasure of (hearing) the noise of the water, that sorely tried man began to hurl and tear off bricks from that place. The water was making a noise, that is to say, (it was crying), “Hey, what is the advantage to you of this hurling a brick at me?” The thirsty man said, “O water, I have two advantages: I will nowise refrain from this work. The first advantage is (my) hearing the noise of the water, which to thirsty men is (melodious) as a rebeck.",20
"The noise thereof has become (to me) like the noise of (the trumpet of) Isráfíl: by this (noise) life has been transferred (restored) to one (that was) dead; Or (it is) like the noise of thunder in days of spring—from it (the thunder) the garden obtains so many (lovely) ornaments; Or like the days of alms to a poor man, or like the message of deliverance to a prisoner. ’Tis like the breath of the Merciful (God) which, without mouth, comes to Mohammed from Yemen; Or ’tis like the scent of Ahmad (Mohammed), the Apostle (of God), which in intercession comes to the sinner;",20
"Or like the scent of beauteous, graceful Joseph, (which) strikes upon the soul of lean Jacob. The other advantage is that, (with) every brick I tear off this (wall), I come (nearer) to running water, Since by diminution of the bricks the high wall becomes lower every time that one is removed. The lowness (destruction) of the wall becomes a means of access (to the water); separation from it is the remedy bringing about a union (with the water).” The tearing away of the adhesive (firmly joined) bricks is (analogous to) prostration (in prayer): (it is) the cause of nearness (to God), for (God has said), ‘And prostrate thyself and draw near (to Me).’",20
"So long as this wall is high-necked (lofty and proud), it is an obstacle to this bowing of the head (in prayer). ’Tis impossible to perform the prostration on the Water of Life, until I gain deliverance from this earthly body. The more thirsty any one on the top of the wall is, the more quickly does he tear off the bricks and turfs. The more any one is in love with the noise of the water, the bigger clods does he tear away from the barrier. He, at the noise of the water, is filled with wine (ecstasy) up to the neck, (while) the stranger (to love) hears nothing but the sound of the splash.",20
"Oh, blest is he that deems his early days an opportunity to be seized, and pays his debt— In the days when he has the power, (when) he has health and strength of heart and vigour, And (when) that season of youth, like a garden green and fresh, is bringing (to ripeness) produce and fruit without any stint; (When) the fountains of strength and lust (are) flowing, (so that) thereby the soil of the body is made verdant; (When he is still like) a well-kept house, with its roof very lofty, its sides (walls) symmetrical, without buttressing and clamps —",20
"Ere the days of eld arrive and bind your neck with a halter of palm-fibres; (Ere) the soil becomes nitrous (barren), crumbling, and poor —never did good herbage grow from nitrous soil; (When) the water of strength and the water of lust (is) cut off, and he has no profit from himself or others: The eyebrows fallen down like a crupper-strap; the eyes grown moist and dim; The face, from wrinkling, like the back of a lizard; speech and taste and teeth gone out of use;",20
"The day late, the ass lame, and the way long; the shop ruined and the business in disorder; The roots of bad habit firmly set, and the power to tear them up decreased. How the Governor commanded a certain man, saying, “Root up the thorn bush which you have planted on the road.” As (for example) that callous fair-spoken person planted a thorn bush in the middle of the road. The wayfarers reproached him and oftentimes told him to dig it up: he dug it not up. Every moment the thorn bush was growing bigger: the people's feet were streaming with blood from its pricks.",20
"The people's clothes were being rent by the thorns: the feet of the poor were being wounded pitiably. When the Governor said to him with earnestness, “Dig this up,” he replied, “Yes, I will dig it up some day.” For a long while he promised (to dig it up) to-morrow and to-morrow; (meantime) his thorn bush became robust in constitution. One day the Governor said to him, “O false promiser, go forward with my affair, do not creep back.” He replied, “O uncle, the days are between us.” “Make haste,” said he, “do not put off payment of my debt.”",20
"You who say “To-morrow,” be aware of this, that with every day that time is coming (and going), That evil tree is growing younger, while this digger is waxing old and sorely distressed. The thorn bush (is) in (process of gaining) strength and (in) ascent; its digger (is) in (process of) aging and decline. The thorn bush every day and every moment is green and fresh; its digger is every day more sickly and withered. It is growing younger, you older: be quick and do not waste your time!",20
"Know that every single bad habit of yours is a thorn bush: many a time, after all, have its thorns pierced your foot. Many a time have you been wounded by your own (evil) habits—you have no sense, you are very senseless. If to the wounding of other persons, which comes to pass from your evil nature, You are indifferent, at any rate you are not (indifferent) to your own wounds: you are the torment of yourself and of every stranger. Either take up the axe and strike like a man—like ‘Alí, destroy this gate of Khaybar—",20
"Or unite these thorns with the rosebush: unite the light of the friend (of God) with the (sensual) fire, In order that his light may extinguish your fire, (and that) union with him may make your thorns roses. You are like Hell, he is a true believer: the extinction of the fire (of Hell) by means of a true believer is possible. Mustafá (Mohammed) said concerning the speech of Hell, that on account of fear it begins humbly to entreat the true believer, And says to him, “Pass quickly away from me, O king: hark, for thy light has taken away the burning of my fire.”",20
"Therefore the true believer's light is the death of the fire, because without an opposite the removal of the (other) opposite is impossible. On the Day of Justice (Judgement) the fire will be the opponent of the light, since the former was aroused by (God's) wrath, the latter by (His) grace. If you are wishing to remove the evil of the fire, direct the water of (Divine) mercy against the heart of the fire. The true believer is the fountain of that water of mercy: the pure spirit of the well-doer is the Water of Life. Hence your fleshly soul is fleeing from him, because you are of fire, (while) he (is) the water of the stream.",20
"Fire becomes fleeing from water for the reason that its fire (flame and heat) is ruined by water. Your sense and thought are wholly of the fire; the sense of the Shaykh (spiritual guide) and his thought are the beauteous Light. When the water of his light trickles on the fire, chak chak (a gnashing sound) rises from the fire, and it leaps up (in fury). When it makes (the sound) chak chak, say you to it, “Death and woe (to thee),” in order that this hell, (which is) your fleshly soul, may become cold (quenched), So that it may not burn your rose-garden, so that it may not burn your justice and well doing.",20
"After that, anything that you sow will yield fruit (or flowers); it will yield anemones and wild roses and thyme. Once more we are going wide of the straight way: turn back, O master—where is our way? We were (engaged) in showing, O envious one, that your ass is lame and the place of alighting (journey's end) far off, (so you must be) quick. The year has turned late; it is not sowing-time, (and you have produced) nothing except black shame and foul deeds. The worm has entered the root of the body's tree: it must be dug up and put in the fire.",20
"Hark and hark (again), O wayfarer! ’Tis late, life's sun is gone towards the pit (is about to set). (During) these (one or) two brief days when you have (some) strength, (be) quick, flap your wings generously. Devote this (small) amount of seed that you have remaining, in order that long life may grow from these (one or) two moments. Whilst this jewelled lamp is not (yet) extinguished, see you trim its wick and (supply it with) oil immediately. Beware! Do not say “To-morrow”—for (many) to-morrows have passed. Let not the days of sowing pass away altogether.",20
"Listen to my admonition that the body is a strong bond: put off the old, if you have desire for newness. Shut the lips and open the palm filled with gold: leave off being a miser with the body, exhibit munificence. Munificence is the abandonment of lusts and pleasures; no one who is sunken in lust rises up (again). This munificence is a branch of the cypress of Paradise: woe to him that lets such a branch go from his hand! This abandonment of sensuality is the firmest handle: this branch draws the spirit up to Heaven.",20
"(So act) that the branch of munificence, O righteous man, drawing you aloft may bear you to its origin. You are Joseph (full) of beauty, and this world is as the well, and this rope (to draw you forth) is patience with (submission to) the command of God. O Joseph, the rope is come: put your two hands upon it. Do not neglect the rope, (for) it has grown late. Praise be to God, that this rope has been dangled, (and that) grace and mercy have been blended together, So that you may behold the world of the new spirit, a world very manifest, (though) invisible.",20
"This (phenomenal) world of non-existence has become like (real) existence, while that world of (real) existence has become very hidden. The dust is on the wind: it is playing, it is making a false show and forming a veil. This, which is busy (in appearance), is (really) idle and (superficial, like) a husk; and that which is hidden is its core and origin. The dust is as a tool in the hand of the wind: deem the wind high and of high descent. The gaze of the eye of dust falls on the dust; an eye that sees the wind is of another sort.",20
"A horse knows a horse, because it (one horse) is associated (homogeneous with other horses); likewise (only) a rider knows the things appertaining to a rider. The sensuous eye is the horse, and the Light of God is the rider: without the rider the horse itself is useless. Therefore train the horse (so as to cure it) of bad habits; else the horse will be rejected before the King. The horse's eye finds the way from the King's eye: without the King's eye its eye is in desperate plight. The eye of horses, whithersoever you call it except to grass and pasture, says, “Nay, why (should we go)?”",20
"The Light of God mounts (as a rider) on the sensuous eye, and then the soul yearns after God. How should the riderless horse know the marks of the road? The King is needed (to ride it) in order that it may know the King's road. Go towards a sense on which the Light is riding: that Light is a good companion for the sense. The Light of God is an ornament to the light of sense: this is the meaning of light upon light. The light of sense draws (a man) towards earth; the Light of God bears him aloft,",20
"Because sensible things are a lower world: the Light of God is (as) the sea, and the sense as a dew-drop. But that which rides on it (on the sense) is not manifested save by good effects and words. The sensuous light, which is gross and heavy, is hidden in the black of the eyes. Inasmuch as you are not seeing the light of sense with (your) eye, how should you see the light of that religious one (the saint)with (your) eye? The light of sense is hidden notwithstanding this grossness: how (then) should not that radiance be hidden which is pure (and subtle)?",20
"This world, like straws in the hand (sway) of the wind, (which is) the (world) unseen, has adopted helplessness as its (only) resource; and the dispensation of the Unseen Makes it now lofty, now low; makes it now sound (and whole), now broken; Now carries it to the right, now to the left; now makes it roses, now thorns. See (how) the Hand (is) hidden, while the pen is writing; the horse careering, while the Rider is invisible. See the arrow flying, and the Bow not in sight; the (individual) souls manifest, and the Soul of souls hidden.",20
"Do not break the arrow, for it is the arrow of a King; it is not shot at long range (at random), it is from the thumb-stall of One who knows (how to hit the target). God said, “Thou didst not throw when thou threwest”: the action of God has precedence over (our) actions. Break your own anger, do not break the arrow: the eye of your anger reckons milk (to be) blood. Give the arrow a kiss and bring it to the King—the blood-stained arrow, wet with your blood. That which is seen is helpless and confined and feeble; and that which is unseen is so fierce and uncontrollable.",20
"We are the (hunted) prey: to whom belongs such a (fearful) snare? We are the ball (for the blows) of the polo-bat— and where is the Batsman? He tears, He sews: where is this Tailor? He blows, He burns: where is this Firekindler? At one hour He makes the true saint an unbeliever; at another hour He makes the (impious) deist an (orthodox) ascetic; For the mukhlis (sincere worshipper) is in danger of the snare until he becomes entirely purged of self, Because he is (still) on the Way, and the brigands are numberless: (only) he escapes who is under God's safeguard.",20
"(If) he has not become (selfless, like) a pure mirror, he is (no more than) mukhlis: (if) he has not caught the bird, he is (still) hunting; (But) when the mukhlis has become mukhlas, he is delivered: he has reached the place of safety and has won the victory. No mirror (ever) became iron again; no bread (ever) became the wheat in the stack. No full-grown grape (ever) became a young grape; no mature fruit (ever) became premature fruit. Become mature and be far from (the possibility of) change for the worse: go, become the Light, like Burhán-i Muhaqqiq.",20
"When you have escaped from self, you have become wholly the proof (of God): when the slave (in you) has become naught, you have become the King. [And if you wish to behold (this mystery) plainly, Saláhu’ddín has shown it forth: he has made the eyes to see and has opened (them). From his eyes and mien every eye that hath the Light of Hú (God) has discerned (mystical) poverty. The Shaykh (Saláhu’ddín) is one who, like God, acts without instrument, giving lessons to his disciples without anything said.] In his hand the heart is submissive like soft wax: his seal makes (the impression) now (of) shame, now (of) fame.",20
"The seal impressed on his wax is telling of the seal-ring; of whom, again, does the device tell, (which is) graven on the stone of the ring? It tells of the thought of the Goldsmith—(all this) is a chain, every link (inserted) in another. Whose voice is this echo in the mountains of (our) hearts? Sometimes this mountain is full of the voice, sometimes it is empty. Wheresoever he is, he is the Sage, the Master—may his voice not forsake this mountain! There is a mountain that (only) doubles the voice; there is a mountain that makes it hundredfold.",20
"At that voice and speech the mountain lets gush forth hundreds of thousands of springs of clear water. Inasmuch as that grace emanates (even) from the mountain, the waters in the springs become blood. ’Twas on account of that monarch of auspicious gait that Mount Sinai was (turned to) rubies from end to end. (All) the parts of the mountain received life and intelligence— after all, are we inferior to stone, O people? Neither is there gushing from the soul a single spring, nor is the body becoming one of those clad in green;",20
"Neither is there in it the echo of the cry of longing, nor the purity (born) of the draught of (wine bestowed by) the Cup-bearer. Where is (so great) zeal, that they should entirely dig up such a mountain as this with axe and with pick?— (In the hope that) maybe a Moon will shine upon its particles, (that) maybe the radiance of the Moon will find a way into it. Inasmuch as the (temporal) Resurrection shall dig up the mountains, how shall it cast the shadow (of protection) over us? How is this (spiritual) Resurrection inferior to that (temporal) Resurrection? That (temporal) Resurrection is the wound, and this (spiritual) Resurrection is as the plaster.",20
"Every one that has seen (experienced) this plaster is safe from the wound: every evil one that has seen this good is a well-doer. Oh, happy is the ugly one to whom the beauteous one has become a companion; alas for one of rosy countenance with whom autumn has consorted! When lifeless bread is companioned with life, the bread becomes living and is turned into the substance of that (life). Dark faggots become the companions of fire: the darkness departed, and all was turned into light. When the dead ass fell into the salt-mine, it put aside asininity and mortality.",20
"The baptism of Allah is the dyeing-vat of Hú (the Absolute God): therein (all) piebald things become of one colour. When he (the mystic) falls into the vat, and you say to him, “Arise,” he says in rapture, “I am the vat: do not blame (me).” That “I am the vat” is the (same as) saying “I am God”: he has the colour of the fire, albeit he is iron. The colour of the iron is naughted in the colour of the fire: it (the iron) boasts of (its) fieriness, though (actually) it is like one who keeps silence. When it has become like gold of the mine in redness, then without tongue its boast is “I am the fire.”",20
"It has become glorified by the colour and nature of the fire: it says, “I am the fire, I am the fire. I am the fire; if thou have doubt and suspicion, make trial, put thy hand upon me. I am the fire; if it seem dubious to thee, lay thy face upon my face for one moment.” When Man receives light from God, he is worshipped by the angels because of his being chosen (by God). Also, (he is) worshipped by that one whose spirit, like the angel, has been freed from contumacy and doubt.",20
"What fire? What iron? Close your lips: do not laugh at the beard of the assimilator's simile. Do not set foot in the Sea, speak not of It: on the shore of the Sea keep silence, biting your lips (in amazement). Though (one equal to) a hundred like me would not have the strength to bear the Sea, yet I cannot refrain from the drowning waters of the Sea. May my soul and mind be a sacrifice to the Sea: this Sea has paid the blood-price of mind and soul. I will march in It as long as my feet move; when feet remain not, I am (plunged) in It, like ducks.",20
"An unrespectful person present is better than one absent: though the ring be crooked, is it not on the door? O defiled in body, frequent the tank: outside of the tank, how shall a man be cleansed? The pure one who has been banished from the tank becomes far also from his purity. The purity of this tank is infinite; the purity of bodies is of little weight, Because the heart (though it) is a tank, yet in ambush (out of sight) it has a hidden channel to the Sea.",20
"Your finite purity wants reinforcement; otherwise, number is diminished in (the course of) expenditure. The water said to the defiled one, “Hasten (to come) into me.” The defiled one said, “I feel shame before the water.” Said the water, “Without me how shall this shame go? Without me how shall this defilement be removed?” Every defiled one who hides from the water is (an example of the saying that) “Shame hinders Faith.” The heart is muddied by the steps of the body's tank; the body is cleansed by the water of the heart's tanks.",20
"Haunt the steps of the heart's tank, O son; take heed and always beware of the steps of the body's tank. The sea of the body is dashing against the sea of the heart, (but) between them is a barrier which they shall not cross. Whether you be straight (righteous) or crooked, always creep forwards to Him; do not creep backwards. If in the presence of kings there be danger to life, yet they that aspire cannot refrain from (presence with) Him. Since the King is sweeter than sugar, ’tis better that life should go (as a sacrifice) to (that) sweetness.",20
"O blamer (of lovers), safety be thine! O seeker of safety, thou art infirm. My soul is a furnace: it is happy with the fire: ’tis enough for the furnace that it is the fire's house. For Love, as (for) the furnace, there is something to be burned: any one that is blind to this is not a furnace. When the provision of unprovidedness has become your provision, you have gained life everlasting, and death is gone. When the pain (of love) has begun to increase your (spiritual) joy, roses and lilies have taken possession of the garden of your soul.",20
"That which is the dread of others is your safety (safeguard): the duck is (made) strong by the river, the domestic fowl weak. Once more have I become mad, O Physician! Once more have I become frenzied, O Beloved! The rings (links) of Thy chain are multiform: every single ring gives a different madness. The gift of every ring is (consists in) different forms: therefore I have a different madness at every moment. So “Madness is of different forms”—this has become a proverb; especially (is it true) as regards the chain of this most glorious Prince.",20
"Such a madness has broken the bonds (of my reason) that all madmen would give me admonition. How friends came to the madhouse for Dhu ’l-Nún—may God sanctify his honoured spirit! It so happened to Dhu ’l-Nún the Egyptian that a new agitation and madness was born within him. His agitation became so great that salt (bitterness) from it was reaching (all) hearts up to above the sky. Beware, O (thou of) salty soil, do not put thy agitation beside (in comparison with) the agitation of the holy lords (saints). The people could not endure his madness: his fire was carrying off their beards.",20
"When (that) fire fell on the beards of the vulgar, they bound him and put him in a prison. There is no possibility of pulling back this rein, though the vulgar be distressed by this way. These (spiritual) kings have seen (themselves in) danger of their lives from the vulgar; for this multitude are blind, and the kings (are) without (a visible) mark. When authority is in the hands of profligates, (a) Dhu ’l-Nún is inevitably in prison. The great king rides alone! Such a unique pearl in the hands of children!",20
"What pearl? (Nay), the Sea hidden in a drop, a Sun concealed in a mote. A Sun showed itself as a mote, and little by little uncovered its face. All motes vanished in it; the (whole) world became intoxicated by it and (then) became sober. When the pen (of authority) is in the hand of a traitor, unquestionably Mansúr is on a gibbet. When this affair (dominion) belongs to the foolish, the necessary consequence is (that) they kill the prophets.",20
"Through folly the people who had lost the (right) way said to the prophets, “Lo, we augur ill from you.” See the ignorance of the Christian appealing for protection to the Lord who was suspended (on the Cross)! Since, according to his (the Christian's) belief, He was crucified by the Jews, how then can He protect him? Inasmuch as the heart of that King (Jesus) bleeds on account of them (the Christians), how should there be (for them) the inviolable defence of whilst thou art amongst them? To the pure gold and to the goldsmith the danger from the false counterfeiter is greater (than from any one else).",20
"Josephs are concealed on account of the jealousy of the ugly, for because of enemies the beautiful live in the fire (of tribulation). Josephs are in the pit through the guile of (their) brethren, who from envy give Joseph to the wolves. What happened to Joseph of Egypt on account of envy? This envy is a big wolf in covert. Of necessity, kind Jacob always had fear and dread for Joseph because of this wolf. The outward (visible) wolf, indeed, did not prowl about (approach) Joseph; (but) this envy has actually surpassed wolves (in malignity).",20
"This wolf dealt its wound, and by way of specious excuse came (the words), “Lo, we went to compete with one another.” Hundreds of thousands of wolves have not this cunning; (but) this wolf will at last be put to shame—stop (and see)!— Because on the Day of Bale the envious will without doubt be (raised from the dead and) brought together (to Judgement) in the shape of wolves. The resurrection of the greedy vile eater of carrion (unlawful food) will be in the shape of a hog on the Day of Reckoning. Adulteris (erit) foetor membri latentis; wine-drinkers will have stinking mouths.",20
"The hidden stench that was reaching (only) to (people's) hearts will become sensible and manifest at the Resurrection. The being of Man is a jungle: be on your guard against this being, if you are of that (Divine) Breath. In our being there are thousands of wolves and hogs; (there is) goodly and ungodly and fair and foul. To the disposition that is preponderant belongs the decision (as to what you are): when the gold is more than the copper, it (the mixture) is gold. The manner of acting that preponderates in your nature—in that same form you must needs rise (from the dead).",20
"At one hour a wolf enters into Man, at another hour a moon-like beauty with the face of Joseph. Good and hateful qualities pass from bosoms into bosoms by a hidden way; Nay, indeed, wisdom and knowledge and excellence pass from Man into the ox and the ass. The stumbling (restive) horse becomes smooth-paced and docile; the bear dances, the goat also salaams. Volition has passed from human beings into the dog, so that he has become a shepherd or a hunter or a guardian (of the house).",20
"Into the dog of the Companions (of the Cave) there passed from those Sleepers a (moral) disposition, so that he had become a seeker of God. At every moment a (different) species bursts up in the breast: now a devil, and now an angel, now wild beasts. From that marvellous Jungle with which every lion is acquainted, there is a hidden way to the breasts which ensnare (the spiritual prey). O you who are less than a dog, steal the spiritual pearl from within—from within (the breasts of) them that know God. As you (must) steal, at any rate (let it be) that lovely pearl; as you are going to bear a burden, at any rate (let it be) a noble one. How the disciples understood that Dhu ’l-Nún had not become mad, (but) had acted with intention.",20
"The friends went to the prison (to inquire) about the story of Dhu ’l-Nún, and expressed an opinion concerning it, Saying, “Perchance he does this purposely, or there is some (deep) wisdom (in it): he is an exemplar and a shining light in this religion. Far, far be it from his sea-like (profound) intelligence that madness should prompt him to folly! God forbid, in view of the perfection of his (spiritual) attainments, that the cloud of sickness should cover his moon! He has gone into the house (and taken refuge) from the wickedness of the vulgar: he has become mad on account of the infamy of the sane.",20
"From (feeling) the disgrace of the dull body-serving intellect, he has purposely gone and become mad, Saying, ‘Bind me fast and with the tail of a cow smite me on head and back, and do not dispute this (matter), That from the stroke of the part (of the cow) I may gain life, as the murdered man (gained life) from the cow of Moses, O trusty ones; That I may be made happy by the stroke of a part of the cow; (that I may) become well (whole), like the murdered man (by means) of the cow of Moses’.” The murdered man was revived by the stroke of the cow's tail: he became pure gold (in spirit), even as copper (is transmuted) by the elixir.",20
"The murdered man sprang up and told the secrets: he revealed that bloodthirsty gang. He said plainly, “I was killed by these people who are now disturbed (with anger) in contending against me.” When this gross body is killed, the essence that knows (spiritual) secrets is brought to life. Its spirit beholds Paradise and Hell-fire and discerns all the mysteries. It reveals the devilish murderers, it reveals the snare of deceit and guile.",20
"To kill the cow (the fleshly soul) is the stipulation of (imposed by) the (Súfí) Path, in order that the spirit may be restored to consciousness by the stroke of her tail.Kill most quickly the cow, your fleshly soul, so that the hidden spirit may become alive and conscious. Resumption of the story of Dhu ’l-Nún, may God sanctify his spirit! When those persons arrived near him, he shouted, “Hey, who are ye? Take care!” They said respectfully, “We are some of thy friends: we have come hither in devotion to ask after thee. How art thou, O Sea of manifold intelligence? What aspersion on thy intelligence is this (alleged) madness?",20
"How should the smoke of the bath-stove attain unto the Sun? How should the ‘Anqá be crushed by the crow? Do not withhold (the truth) from us: explain this matter; we are lovers (of thee): do not behave to us in this fashion. One ought not to drive lovers away or dupe them by mask and false pretence. Communicate the secret, O King: do not hide thy face in the cloud, O Moon! We are loving and true and with wounded (bleeding) hearts: in the two worlds we have fixed our hearts on thee (alone).”",20
"He began (to use) foul words and bad names recklessly: he spoke gibberish like madmen. He jumped up and let fly stones and sticks; the whole party fled for fear of blows. He laughed loudly and tossed his head (in scorn). “Look,” said he, “at the vain bluster of these friends! See the friends! Where is the sign of (true) friends? To (true) friends pain is as (dear as) life.” How should a friend turn aside from the pain inflicted by his friend? Pain is the kernel, and friendship is (only) as the husk to it.",20
"Has not joy in tribulation and calamity and suffering become the sign of (true) friendship? A friend is like gold, tribulation is like the fire: the pure gold is glad in the heart of the fire. How Luqmán's master tested his sagacity. (Was it) not (the case) that (this happened) to Luqmán, who was a pure (unselfish) slave, and day and night was brisk in service? His master used to prefer him (to all others) in the work (of service) and deem him better than his own sons, Because Luqmán, though he was slave-born, was the master (of himself) and was free from sensual desire.",21
"A certain king said to the Shaykh (spiritual Director) in conversation, “Ask me to bestow some bounty upon thee.” He answered, “O King, are not you ashamed to say such a thing to me? Come higher! I have two slaves, and they are vile, and those two are rulers and lords over you.” Said the King, “What are those two? That is a mistake.” He replied, “The one is anger and the other is lust.” Regard as a king him that is unconcerned with kingship, him whose light shines forth without moon or sun.",21
"(Only) that one whose essence is the treasury (of spiritual truths) possesses the treasury: (only) he that is an enemy to (his own) existence possesses (real) existence. Luqmán's master (was) like a master outwardly; in reality his (Luqmán's) master (was) Luqmán's slave. In the topsy-turvy world there is many a one of this (kind): a pearl is less than a straw in their sight. Every desert has been named mafáza (place of safety): a name and specious form has ensnared their understanding. In the case of one class of people, the dress makes (a man) known: (if he is dressed) in a qabá, they say that he belongs to the vulgar.",21
"In the case of one class of people (the distinguishing mark is) the hypocritical appearance of asceticism; (but) light is needed, that (any one) may be a spy on asceticism (and detect its true character). Light is needed, (a light) purged of cant and noxiousness, that he may know a man without (the evidence of) deed or word, And enter into his heart by way of the intellect, and behold his real state and not be confined to tradition. The chosen servants of (God) the Knower of things unseen are, in the spiritual world, the spies on hearts. He (such a one) enters within the heart like a fancy: the mystery of the (real) state is unveiled to him.",21
"In the body of the sparrow what power and faculty is there that is hidden from the intellect of the falcon? He who has become acquainted with the secrets of Hú (God), what to him is the secret (inmost consciousness) of created beings? He whose walk is on the spheres, how should it be hard for him to walk on the earth? Since iron became wax in the hand of David, what should wax be in his hand, O man of iniquity? Luqmán was a slave in appearance, a master (in reality): servitude was (only) a frontispiece on his outside.",21
"When the master goes to a place where he is not known, he puts (his own) clothes on his slave. He (himself) puts on the slave's clothes and makes his slave the leader. He goes behind him on the road, as slaves do, lest any one should recognise him (as the master). “O slave,” says he, “go you and sit in the place of honour: I will take (your) shoes, like the meanest slave. Treat (me) roughly and revile me; do not bestow any respect on me.",21
"I hold neglect of service to be your (proper) service, since I have sown the seed of contrivance by dwelling in a foreign land.” Masters have performed these slavish offices in order that it might be thought that they were slaves. They saw their fill of masterdom and were sated (with it): (hence) they have made ready for (doing) the work (of slaves). On the contrary, these slaves of sensuality have represented themselves as masters of intellect and spirit. From the master (the spiritual man) comes the practice of self-abasement; from the slave (the sensual man) comes naught but slavishness.",21
"So topsy-turvy, then, are the arrangements between that world and this world. Know this (for sure). Luqmán's master was aware of this hidden state (of Luqmán); he had seen signs (thereof) in him. That traveller (Luqmán's master) knew the secret, (but) quietly pursued his way for the sake of the good (which he had in view). He would have set him free at the first, but he sought to content (comply with the wish of) Luqmán, Because it was Luqmán's desire (to remain a slave), in order that none might know the secret of that brave and generous youth.",21
"What wonder (is it) that you should hide your secret from the evil (one)? The wonder is this, that you should hide the secret from yourself. Hide your work from your own eyes, that your work may be safe from the evil eye. Yield yourself up to the snare of the (Divine) reward, and then, (being) beside yourself, steal something from yourself. They give opium to the wounded man, in order that they may extract the point (of a spear or arrow) from his body. At the hour of death he is torn with pain; he becomes preoccupied with that, and (meanwhile) his spirit (life) is taken away.",21
"Inasmuch as, to whatsoever thought you give up your mind, something will secretly be taken away from you, (And inasmuch as) whatsoever you may cogitate and (whatsoever) acquisition you may make, the thief will enter from the side where you feel safe, Become occupied, therefore, with that which is better, in order that the thief may take away from you something that is less (in worth). When the trader's bales fall into the water, he lays his hands upon the better merchandise. Since something will (certainly) be lost in the water, take leave of the less (worse) and gain (possession of) the better. How the excellence and sagacity of Luqmán became manifest to those who made trial (of him).",21
"Whatever food they brought to him (Luqmán's master), he would send some one to Luqmán after (receiving it), That Luqmán might put his hand to (partake of) it, on purpose that the master might eat his (Luqmán's) leavings. He would eat his remnants and be enraptured: any food that he (Luqmán) did not taste, he (the master) would throw away; Or if he ate (of it), (’twould be) without heart and without appetite: this is (the sign of) an affinity without end. They had brought a melon as a present. “Go,” said he, “call (hither) my son, Luqmán.”",21
"When he cut it and gave him a slice, he ate it as if it were sugar and honey. On account of the pleasure with which he ate (it), he gave him a second (slice), (and went on) till the slices (given him) reached the seventeenth. One slice remained. He said, “I will eat this (myself), so that I may see what a sweet melon this is. He (Luqmán) eats it with such pleasure that from his delight (all) natures have become eager and craving the morsel.” As soon as he (the master) ate it, by its sourness there was kindled fire (which) blistered his tongue and burnt his throat.",21
"He became beside himself for a while on account of its sourness; after that, he said to him, “O (you who are) soul and world, How did you make all this poison an antidote? How did you deem this cruelty to be kindness? What patience is this? For what reason is this great fortitude? Or, perchance, in your opinion this life of yours is an enemy (which you would fain destroy). Why did not you cunningly bring (forward) a plea, saying, ‘I have an excuse (for declining to eat): desist for a while’.” Luqmán said, “From thy munificent hand I have eaten so much that I am (bent) double with shame.",21
"I was ashamed not to eat one bitter thing from thy hand, O thou who art possessed of knowledge. Since all parts of me have grown from thy bounty and are plunged in thy bait and snare— If I make outcry and complaint because of one bitter thing, may the dust of a hundred roads be on (all) parts of me! It (the melon) had the enjoyment of thy sugar-bestowing hand: how could it (such enjoyment) leave any bitterness in this melon?” By love bitter things become sweet; by love pieces of copper become golden;",21
"By love dregs become clear; by love pains become healing; By love the dead is made living; by love the king is made a slave. This love, moreover, is the result of knowledge: who (ever) sat in foolishness on such a throne?On what occasion did deficient knowledge give birth to this love? Deficient (knowledge) gives birth to love, but (only love) for that which is (really) lifeless. When it sees in a lifeless being the colour (appearance) of a desired one, (’tis as though) it heard the voice of a beloved in a whistle.",21
"Deficient knowledge cannot discriminate: of necessity it deems the lightning to be the sun. When the Prophet called the “deficient” (man) accursed, (his meaning) as interpreted was “deficiency of mind,” Because one whose body is deficient is the object of (Divine) mercy: cursing and repulse (directed) against the object of (Divine) mercy are improper. ’Tis deficiency of mind that is the bad disease: it is the cause of (God's) curse and merits banishment (from His presence), Forasmuch as the perfecting of minds is not remote (impossible), but the perfecting of the body is not within our power.",21
"The miscreance and Pharaoh-like pride of every infidel who is far (from God) have all been produced by deficiency of mind. Relief for bodily deficiency has come in the (words of the) Qur’án—it is no crime in the blind man. Lightning is transient and very faithless: without clearness (of mind) you will not know the transient from the permanent. The lightning laughs: say, at whom is it laughing? At him that sets his heart upon its light. The lights of the sky are hamstrung (feeble and imperfect): how are they like (that Light which is) neither of the east nor of the west?",21
"Regard the lightning as (what) taketh away the sight; regard the everlasting Light as entirely Helpers (to the attainment of vision). To ride (your) horse upon the foam of the sea, to read a letter in a flash of lightning, Is, to fail, because of covetousness, to see the end; it is, to laugh at your own mind and intellect. Intellect, by its proper nature, is a seer of the end (consequence); ’tis the fleshly soul that does not see the end. The intellect that is vanquished by the flesh becomes the flesh: Jupiter is checkmated by Saturn and becomes inauspicious.",21
"Still, turn this gaze (of yours) upon this inauspiciousness, look on that One who made you ill-starred. The gaze (of him) that surveys this ebb and flow pierces from the inauspicious influence to the auspicious. He (God) continually turns you from one state (of feeling) to another, manifesting opposite by means of opposite in the change, For the purpose that fear of the left hand side may bring to birth in you the delight of “the (blessed) men are led to hope for the right hand side,” So that you may have two wings (fear and hope); for the bird that has (only) one wing is unable to fly, O excellent (reader).",21
"(O God), either let me not come to speech (at all), or give me leave to tell (the whole) to the end. But if Thou willest neither this nor that, ’tis Thine to command: how should any one know what Thou intendest? One must needs have the spirit of Abraham to see in the fire Paradise and its palaces by the light (of mystic knowledge); And mount step by step above the moon and the sun, lest he remain like the door-ring fastened on the door; And, like the Friend, pass beyond the Seventh Heaven, saying, “I love not them that set.”",21
"This bodily world is deceptive, save to him that has escaped from lust.How reverence for the message of Solomon, on whom be peace, was reflected in the heart of Bilqís from the despicableform of the hoopoe. Hundredfold mercy be on that Bilqís to whom God gave the intellect of a hundred men! A hoopoe brought the letter with the (royal) sign-manual from Solomon—a few eloquent words. (When) she read those pregnant sayings, she did not look with contempt on the messenger. Her eye saw him as a hoopoe, (but) her spirit saw him as the ‘Anqá; her senses saw him as a fleck of foam, (but) her heart saw him as the sea.",21
"Because of these two-coloured (diverse) talismans (appearance and reality) the intellect is at war with the senses, as Mohammed with the likes of Abú Jahl. The infidels regarded Ahmad (Mohammed) as (only) a man, since they did not see in him (the Prophetic nature which was manifested by the miracle) the moon was cleft asunder. Throw dust on your sense-perceiving eye: the sensuous eye is the enemy of intellect and religion. God has called the sensuous eye blind; He has said that it is an idolater and our foe, Because it saw the foam and not the sea, because it saw the present and not to-morrow.",21
"The master of to-morrow and of the present (is) before it; (yet) of a (whole) treasure it sees not (even) a groat. (If) a mote bring a message from yonder Sun, the sun would become a slave to that mote. The drop that has become an envoy from the Sea of Unity— the seven seas would be captive to that drop. If a handful of earth become His courier, His heavens will lay their heads (in homage) before His earth. When the earth of Adam became God's courier, God's angels laid their heads (in worship) before His earth.",21
"Wherefore (was it), pray, that heaven was rent asunder? Because of one (spiritual) eye that an earthly creature opened. Earth, from its grossness, settles beneath water; (but) see how earth has sped beyond the empyrean! Know, then, that the subtlety (of water) is not (derived) from the water: ’tis only the gift of the Bounteous Originator. If He make air and fire low (in place), and if He let the thorn surpass the rose, He is the Ruler and (the One who said) God doeth what He willeth: from the very self of pain He raises the remedy.",21
"If He make air and fire low (in place), and make (them assume the qualities of) darkness and grossness and heaviness, And if He make earth and water high (in place), and make the path of heaven (to be) traversed by foot— Then it has become certain that Thou exaltest whomso Thou wilt: He (God) said to an earthly creature, “Unfold thy wings.” To the creature of fire He said, “Go, become Iblís: begone under the Seventh Earth with (thy) imposture! O earthly Adam, go thou above (the star) Suhá; O fiery Iblís, go to (the bottom of) the Earth.",21
"I am not the four temperaments or the first cause, I am ever remaining in (absolute) control. My action is uncaused and upright (independent): I have (the power of) predetermination, (I have) no cause, O infirm one. I alter My custom at the time (I choose): at the time (I will) I lay the dust (that rises) in front. I say to the sea, ‘Hark, be full of fire!’ I say to the fire, ‘Go, be a rose-garden!’ I say to the mountain, ‘Be light as wool!’ I say to heaven, ‘Be rent asunder before the eye!’",21
"I say, ‘O sun, be joined to the moon!’ I make them both like two black clouds. We make dry the fountain of the sun: by Our art We turn into musk the fountain of blood.” Sun and moon (shall be) like two black oxen: God will fasten a yoke upon their necks. How a philosopher showed disbelief at the recitation of (the text), “if your water shall have sunk into the ground.” A teacher of Qur’án-recitation was reading from the page of the Book, “(if) your water (shall have) sunk into the ground: (that is, if) I stop the water from (reaching) the spring, And hide the water in the depths, and make the springs dry and a place of drought,",21
"Who shall bring the water to the spring again except Me who have no like, the Gracious, the Glorious?” A contemptible philosopher and logician was passing beside the school at that moment. When he heard the verse (of the Qur’án), he said in disapproval, “We bring the water (back) with a mattock; With strokes of the spade and (with) the sharpness of the axe we bring the water up from below.” At night he fell asleep and saw (in dream) a lion-hearted man (who) gave (him) a blow on the face and blinded both his eyes,",21
"And said, “O wretch, if you are speaking the truth, bring up some light with an axe from these two springs of vision.” At (dawn of) day he jumped up and found (he had) two blind eyes: from both his eyes the overflowing light had vanished. If he had moaned and asked pardon (of God), the departed light would have appeared (again) through (God's) kindness; But (the power of) asking pardon, also, is not in (our) hands: the savour of repentance is not the dessert of every inebriate. The wickedness of (his) actions and the disastrousness of (his) denial (of the Truth) had barred the way of repentance to his heart.",21
"His heart became in hardness as the face of a rock: how should repentance cleave it for sowing? Where is one like Shu‘ayb, that by prayer he may make the mountain earth (fit) for sowing? Through the supplication and (firm) belief of that Friend (Abraham) the thing that was hard and impossible became possible. Or, (to give another example), through the Muqawqis' begging the Prophet a stony ground became a goodly cornfield. So, contrariwise, a man's disbelief turns gold into copper and peace into war.",21
"This falseness draws after it an evil transformation: it turns ground capable (of tillage) into stones and pebbles. Nor is it granted to every heart to fall down in prayer: the wages of (Divine) mercy are not the (allotted) portion of every hireling. Beware! Do not commit crime and sin in reliance on (the thought), “I will repent and come to (take) refuge (with God).” For (true) repentance, there must needs be a glow (of inward feeling) and a flood (of tears): (such) lightning and clouds are the condition indispensable to repentance. There must needs be fire and water (rain) for the fruit: clouds and lightning are necessary for this accomplishment.",21
"Until there is the lightning of the heart and the rain-clouds of the two eyes, how shall the fire of (Divine) menace and wrath be allayed? How shall the herbage grow, (the herbage) of the delight of union (with God)? How shall the fountains of clear water gush forth? How shall the rose-beds tell their secret to the garden? How shall the violet make an engagement with the jasmine? How shall a plane-tree open its hands (spread its leaves) in prayer? How shall any tree toss its head in the air (of love-desire)?How shall the blossoms begin to shake out their sleeves full of largesse in the days of Spring?",21
"How shall the cheeks of the anemone flame like blood? How shall the rose bring gold out of its purse? How shall the nightingale come and smell the rose? How shall the dove say “coo, coo,” as one that seeks? How shall the stork utter with (all) its soul the cry lak, lak? What is (the meaning of) lak? (It means) “Thine is the kingdom, O Thou whose help is invoked.” How shall the earth show forth the secrets of its inmost mind? How shall the garden become radiant as the sky? Whence have they fetched those garments (fair qualities)? (They have derived) all of them from One who is Bounteous and Merciful.",21
"Those graces are the signs of a Witness: they are the footprints of a man devoted to (God's) service. (None but) that person that has seen the King is gladdened by the sign; when one has not seen Him, there is no recognition. The spirit of that one who at the time of Am not I (your Lord)? saw his Lord and became beside himself and intoxicated— He (that spirit) knows the scent of the wine because he drank it (before); when he has not drunk it, he cannot scent it. For Wisdom is like a stray camel: like a go-between, it guides (those who find and recognise it) to (the presence of) kings.",21
"You behold in dream a person of pleasing countenance, who gives you a promise and a sign That your desire will come to pass; here is the sign—such and such a person will meet you to-morrow. One sign is that he will be riding; one sign is that he will clasp you to his breast; One sign is that he will smile before you; one sign is that he will fold his hands in your presence; One sign is that when the morrow comes you will not tell this dream to any one, though you would fain do so.",21
"Concerning that (last-mentioned) sign, He (God) said to the father of Yahyá (John the Baptist), “Thou shalt not begin to speak at all till three days (have passed). For three nights keep silence as to thy good and ill: this will be the sign that Yahyá will come (be born) to thee. During three days do not breathe a word, for this silence is the sign of (the fulfilment) of thy purpose. Beware! do not thou speak of this sign, and keep this matter hidden in thy heart.” He (the person dreamed of) will sweetly tell these signs to him (the dreamer). What are these signs (alone)? (He will tell him) a hundred signs besides.",21
"This (which follows) is the sign that you will gain from God the (spiritual) kingdom and power that you are seeking— That you weep continually in the long nights, and that you are always ardent in supplication at the hour of dawn; That, in the absence of that (which you seek), your day has become dark; (that) your neck has become thin as a spindle; And what you have given in alms (is) all that you possess, (so that) your belongings (are entirely bestowed in charity) like the alms of those who gamble all away; (That) you have given up your belongings and sleep and the (healthy) colour of your face, and sacrificed your head (life) and become as (thin as) a hair;",21
"(That) you have sat—how often!—in the fire, like aloes-wood; that you have gone—how often!—to meet the sword, like a helmet. A hundred thousand such acts of helplessness are habitual to lovers (of God), and (their number) cannot be reckoned. After you have had this dream at night, the day breaks; through hope thereof your day becomes triumphant. You have turned your eye to left and right, (wondering) where is that sign and those tokens. You are trembling like a leaf (and saying), “Alas, if the day depart and the sign come not to pass!”",21
"You are running in street and market and into houses, like one that should lose a calf. (Somebody asks), “Is it good (news), Sir? Why are you running to and fro? Who belonging to you is it that you have lost here?” “It is good (news),” you tell him, “but none may know my good (news) except myself. If I tell it, lo, my sign is missed, and when the sign is missed, the hour of death is come.” You peer into the face of every rider: he says to you, “Do not look at me like a madman.”",21
"You say to him, “I have lost a friend; I have set out to seek him. May thy fortune be lasting, O rider! Have pity on lovers and excuse (them).” When you have made search (and your) looking has been in earnest—earnest endeavour does not fail: so the Tradition has come down (from the Prophet)— Suddenly comes a blessed rider; then he clasps you very closely to his breast. You become senseless and fall to vaunting (ecstatically); the ignorant (uninitiated) man says, “Here is fraud and hypocrisy.”",21
"How does he see what this enthusiasm in him (the enraptured person) is? He knows not (who it is) with whom that is the sign of union. This sign concerns (only) him that has seen (before): how should the sign appear to the other one? Every moment that a sign was coming from Him, a (new) spirit was coming into that person's spirit. Water has reached the helpless fish. These signs are (those mentioned in the text) those are the signs of the Book. Hence the signs which are in the prophets are peculiar to (known exclusively by) him who is a friend (knower and lover of God).",21
"This discourse remains imperfect and unsettled; I have no heart (understanding), I am out of my mind: excuse me. How can any one number the motes, especially that one whose understanding has been transported by Love? Shall I number the leaves of the garden? Shall I number the cries of the partridge and the crow? They come not into computation, but I enumerate them for the guidance of him that is put to trial. The sinister influence of Saturn and the auspicious influence of Jupiter come not into computation, though you may enumerate;",21
"But still, some of these two (diverse) effects must be explained—that is, the benefit and injury (which they involve)— In order that some little part of the effects of the (Divine) decree may be made known to the good-fortuned and the ill-starred. He whose ascendant (ruling planet) is Jupiter will be rejoiced by vivacity (of disposition) and eminence; And it will be necessary for him whose ascendant is Saturn to take precautions against every (kind of) mischief in his affairs. If I should speak to one whose (ruling) planet is Saturn of his (Saturn's) fire, it (my discourse) would burn (torment) that hapless man.",21
"Our King (God) has given permission, (saying), “Commemorate Allah”: He saw us in the fire and gave us light. He has said, “Although I far transcend your commemoration (of Me), (and although) the pictorial ideas (of human speech) are not suitable to Me, Yet he that is intoxicated with (pictorial) imagination and fancy will never apprehend My essence without (the help of) similitude.” Bodily commemoration is an imperfect fancy: the Kingly attributes are remote from those (forms of speech). If any one say of a king, “He is not a weaver,” what praise is this? He (that person) is surely ignorant. How Moses, on whom be peace, took offence at the prayer of the shepherd.",22
"Moses saw a shepherd on the way, who was saying, “O God who choosest (whom Thou wilt), Where art Thou, that I may become Thy servant and sew Thy shoes and comb Thy head? That I may wash Thy clothes and kill Thy lice and bring milk to Thee, O worshipful One; That I may kiss Thy little hand and rub Thy little foot, (and when) bedtime comes I may sweep Thy little room, O Thou to whom all my goats be a sacrifice, O Thou in remembrance of whom are my cries of ay and ah!”",22
"The shepherd was speaking foolish words in this wise. Moses said, “Man, to whom is this (addressed)?” He answered, “To that One who created us; by whom this earth and sky were brought to sight.” “Hark!” said Moses, “you have become very backsliding (depraved); indeed you have not become a Moslem, you have become an infidel. What babble is this? what blasphemy and raving? Stuff some cotton into your mouth! The stench of your blasphemy has made the (whole) world stinking: your blasphemy has turned the silk robe of religion into rags.",22
"Shoes and socks are fitting for you, (but) how are such things right for (One who is) a Sun? If you do not stop your throat from (uttering) these words, a fire will come and burn up the people. If a fire has not come, (then) what is this smoke? Why has your soul become black and your spirit rejected (by God)? If you know that God is the Judge, how is it right for you (to indulge in) this doting talk and familiarity? Truly, the friendship of a witless man is enmity: the high God is not in want of suchlike service.",22
"To whom are you saying this? To your paternal and maternal uncles? Are the body and (its) needs among the attributes of the Lord of glory? (Only) he that is waxing and growing drinks milk: (only) he that has need of feet puts on shoes. And if these words (of yours) are (meant) for His servant, of whom God said, ‘He is I and I myself am he’; (For him) of whom He (God) said, ‘Verily, I was sick and thou didst not visit Me,’ (that is), ‘I became ill, not he (the sick man) alone’; (For him) who has become seeing by Me and hearing by Me— this (talk of yours) is foolish nonsense even in regard to that servant.",22
"To speak irreverently to one chosen of God causes the heart (spirit) to perish and keeps the page (record) black. If you should call a man ‘Fátima’—though men and women are all of one kind— He will seek to murder you, so far as it is possible (for him), albeit he is good-natured and forbearing and quiet. (The name) Fátima is (a term of) praise in regard to women, (but) if you address it to a man, ’tis (like) the blow of a spearhead. Hand and foot are (terms of) praise in relation to us; in relation to the holiness of God they are pollution.",22
"(The words) He begat not, He was not begotten are appropriate to Him: He is the Creator of begetter and begotten. Birth is the attribute of everything that is (a) body: whatever is born is on this side of the river, Because it is of (the world of) becoming and decay and (is) contemptible: it is originated and certainly requires an Originator.”He (the shepherd) said, “O Moses, thou hast closed my mouth and thou hast burned my soul with repentance.” He rent his garment and heaved a sigh, and hastily turned his head towards the desert and went (his way). How the high God rebuked Moses, on whom be peace, on account of the shepherd.",22
"A revelation came to Moses from God—“Thou hast parted My servant from Me. Didst thou come (as a prophet) to unite, or didst thou come to sever? So far as thou canst, do not set foot in separation: of (all) things the most hateful to Me is divorce. I have bestowed on every one a (special) way of acting: I have given to every one a (peculiar) form of expression. In regard to him it is (worthy of) praise, and in regard to thee it is (worthy of) blame: in regard to him honey, and in regard to thee poison.",22
"I am independent of all purity and impurity, of all slothfulness and alacrity (in worshipping Me). I did not ordain (Divine worship) that I might make any profit; nay, but that I might do a kindness to (My) servants. In the Hindoos the idiom of Hind (India) is praiseworthy; in the Sindians the idiom of Sind is praiseworthy. I am not sanctified by their glorification (of Me); ’tis they that become sanctified and pearl-scattering (pure and radiant). I look not at the tongue and the speech; I look at the inward (spirit) and the state (of feeling).",22
"I gaze into the heart (to see) whether it be lowly, though the words uttered be not lowly, Because the heart is the substance, speech (only) the accident; so the accident is subservient, the substance is the (real) object. How much (more) of these phrases and conceptions and metaphors? I want burning, burning: become friendly with that burning! Light up a fire of love in thy soul, burn thought and expression entirely (away)! O Moses, they that know the conventions are of one sort, they whose souls and spirits burn are of another sort.”",22
"To lovers there is a burning (which consumes them) at every moment: tax and tithe are not (imposed) on a ruined village. If he (the lover) speak faultily, do not call him faulty; and if he be bathed in blood, do not wash (those who are) martyrs. For martyrs, blood is better than water: this fault (committed by him) is better than a hundred right actions (of another). Within the Ka‘ba the rule of the qibla does not exist: what matter if the diver has no snow-shoes? Do not seek guidance from the drunken: why dost thou order those whose garments are rent in pieces to mend them?",22
"The religion of Love is apart from all religions: for lovers, the (only) religion and creed is—God. If the ruby have not a seal (graven on it), ’tis no harm: Love in the sea of sorrow is not sorrowful. How the (Divine) revelation came to Moses, on whom be peace, excusing that shepherd. After that, God hid in the inmost heart of Moses mysteries which cannot be spoken. Words were poured upon his heart: vision and speech were mingled together. How oft did he become beside himself and how oft return to himself! How oft did he fly from eternity to everlastingness!",22
"If I should unfold (his tale) after this, ’tis foolishness (in me), because the explanation of this is beyond (our) understanding; And if I should speak (thereof), ’twould root up (men's) minds; and if I should write (thereof), ’twould shatter many pens. When Moses heard these reproaches from God, he ran into the desert in quest of the shepherd. He pushed on over the footprints of the bewildered man, he scattered dust from the skirt of the desert. The footstep of a man distraught is, in truth, distinct from the footsteps of others:",22
"(At) one step, (he moves) like the rook (straight) from top to bottom (of the chessboard); (at) one step he goes crossways, like the bishop; Now lifting his crest like a wave; now going on his belly like a fish; Now writing (a description of) his state on some dust, like a geomancer who takes an omen by drawing lines (on earth or sand). At last he (Moses) overtook and beheld him; the giver of glad news said, “Permission has come (from God). Do not seek any rules or method (of worship); say whatsoever your distressful heart desires.",22
"Your blasphemy is (the true) religion, and your religion is the light of the spirit: you are saved, and through you a (whole) world is in salvation. O you who are made secure by God doeth whatso He willeth, go, loose your tongue without regard (for what you say).” He said, “O Moses, I have passed beyond that: I am now bathed in (my) heart's blood. I have passed beyond the Lote-tree of the farthest bourn, I have gone a hundred thousand years' journey on the other side. Thou didst ply the lash, and my horse shied, made a bound, and passed beyond the sky.",22
"May the Divine Nature be intimate with my human nature— blessings be on thy hand and on thine arm! Now my state is beyond telling: this which I am telling is not my (real) state.” You behold the image which is in a mirror: it is your (own) image, it is not the image of the mirror. The breath which the flute-player puts into the flute—does it belong to the flute? No, it belongs to the man (the flute-player). Take good heed! Whether you speak praise (of God) or thanksgiving, know that it is even as the unseemly (words) of that shepherd.",22
"Though your praise is better in comparison with that, yet in relation to God it too is maimed (feeble). How often will you say, when the lid has been raised, “This was not what they were thinking (it was)!” This acceptance (by God) of your praise is from (His) mercy: it is an indulgence (which He grants), like (the indulgence granted in the case of) the prayers of a woman suffering from menorrhagia. Her prayers are stained with blood; your praise is stained with assimilation and qualification. Blood is foul, and (yet) it goes (is washed away) by a (little) water; but the inward part (the inner man) hath impurities",22
"Which fail not (are not removed) from the interior (the heart) of the man of works except by the water of the grace of the Maker. Would that in your bowing low in prayer you would turn your face (to attentive consideration) and apprehend the meaning of “Glory to my Lord!” Saying, “Oh, my prostration (in prayer), like my existence, is unworthy (of Thee): do Thou give good in return for evil!” This earth has the mark of God's clemency, in that it got filth and gave flowers as the produce; In that it covers our pollutions, (and that) buds grow up from it in exchange. ",22
"Therefore, when the infidel saw that in giving and lavishing he was meaner and unwealthier than the earth, (That) flowers and fruit did not grow from his being, (and that) he sought (and achieved) nothing but the corruption of all purities, He said, “I have gone backwards in (my) course. Alas! would that I had (still) been earth! Would that I had not chosen to travel away from earthiness, (and that) like a clod of earth I had gathered some grain! When I travelled, the Way tried me: what was the present I brought (home) from this travelling?”",22
"’Tis from all that propensity of his towards earth that he sees before him no profit in the journey. His turning his face back is that greed and cupidity (of his); his turning his face to the Way is sincerity and supplication. Every herb that has a propensity for (moving) upwards is in (the state of) increase and life and growth; When it has turned its head towards the earth, (it is) in (the state of) decrease and dryness and failure and disappointment. When the propensity of your spirit is upwards, (you are) in (the state of) increase, and that (lofty) place is the place to which you will return;",22
"But if you are upside down, (with) your head towards the earth, (then) you are one that sinks: God loves not them that sink. How Moses, on whom be peace, asked the high God (to explain) the secret of the predominance of the unjust. Moses said, “O Bounteous Disposer, O Thou whom to commemorate for one moment is (worth) a long life, I have seen the crooked, misshapen image in (the mould of) water and clay, and like the angels, my heart has raised an objection, As to what is the purpose of making an image and casting therein the seed of corruption. To kindle the fire of iniquity and corruption; to burn the mosque and those who bend low in prayer;",22
"To set boiling the source of bloody tears for the sake of (receiving) humble entreaties (from the suffering and oppressed)— I know for certain that it is the essence of wisdom (on Thy part), but my aim is (to know this by) actual seeing and vision. That certainty (of mine) says to me, ‘keep silence’; the craving for vision says to me, ‘Make a stir (and outcry).’ Thou hast shown Thy secret to the angels, (namely) that such honey as this is worth the sting. Thou hast displayed the Light of Adam manifestly to the angels, (so that all) the difficulties were explained.",22
"Thy Resurrection declares what is the secret of death: the fruits declare what is the secret of the leaves.” The secret of blood and seed is the excellence of Man; after all, inferiority is antecedent to every superiority. The ignorant (child) first washes the tablet, then he writes the letters upon it. (So) He (God) turns the heart into blood and abject tears, then He writes the (spiritual) mysteries upon it. At the time of washing the tablet (of the heart) one must recognise that it will be made into a book (of mysteries).",22
"When they lay the foundation of a house (to rebuild it), they dig up the first foundation. (Also), people first fetch up clay from the depths of the earth in order that at last you may draw up flowing water. Children weep piteously at cupping, for they know not the secret of the matter; (But) a man, in sooth, gives the cupper gold and fondles the blood-drinking lancet. The porter runs to the heavy load: he snatches the load from others.",22
"Behold the struggle of the porters for the load! Such is the endeavour of him that sees (the truth of) things, Inasmuch as burdens are the foundation of ease, and bitter things, too, are the forerunners of enjoyment. Paradise is compassed about with the things we dislike (to do); the fires (of Hell) are compassed about with our lusts. The seed (source) of the substance of your fire (of torment) is the fresh bough (of lust); (but) he that is burned by the fire (of renunciation) is the comrade of Kawthar. Whosoever is the comrade of affliction in prison—that is the retribution for a mouthful (of unlawful food) and a lust.",22
"Whosoever is the comrade of a high fortune in a palace— that is the reward for some battle-field and sore trial. Whomsoever you have seen unrivalled in (his store of) gold and silver—know that he has been patient in earning. When the (spiritual) eye has become piercing, he (the owner) sees without causes. You who are in (the bondage of) sense- perception, pay you heed to causes! He whose spirit is beyond (the world of) natural properties— to him belongs the position of power to rive (the chain of) causes. The (spiritual) eye regards the fountain of the miracles of the prophets as (being) without cause, not as (arising) from water and herbage.",22
"These causes are (linked together) like the physician and the sick: these causes are like the lamp and the wick. Twist a new wick for your night-lamp, (but) know that the lamp of the sun transcends these things. Go you and make plaster for the roof of your house, (but) know that the roof of the sky is undefiled by plaster. Alas that, after our Sweetheart had burned (utterly destroyed) our pain, the night-time of being alone (with Him) passed away and became day! Except at night there is no unveiling of the moon: except through heartache do not seek your heart's desire.",22
"Forsaking Jesus, you have fostered the ass: of necessity, like the ass, you are outside of the curtain. Knowledge and gnosis are the fortune of Jesus; they are not the fortune of the ass, O you asinine one! You listen to the moaning of the ass, and pity comes over you; then you know not (that) the ass commands you to be asinine. Have pity on Jesus and have no pity on the ass: do not make the (carnal) nature lord over your intellect. Let the (carnal) nature weep sore and bitterly: do you take from it and pay the debt of the (rational) soul.",22
"For years you have been the ass's slave. It is enough, for the ass's slave is behind (even) the ass. The thing meant by (the Prophet's words) “put them (the women) behind” is your fleshly soul; for it must be last, and your intellect (must be) first. This base intellect has become of the same temperament as the ass: its (only) thought is how it shall get hold of fodder. The ass of Jesus took (to itself) the temperament of the (rational) spirit: it took its abode in the place of the intelligent, Because (in Jesus) intellect was ruling, and the ass (was) weak —the ass is made lean by a strong rider—",22
"While from the weakness of your intellect, O you who have (no more than) the value of an ass, this worn-out ass has become a dragon. If through Jesus (the spiritual guide) you have become heart-sick, (yet) health too comes from him: do not leave him. How art thou as to affliction, O thou Jesus who hast the (healing) breath of Jesus? For there never was in the world a treasurewithout a snake. How art thou, O Jesus, at the sight of the Jews? How art thou, O Joseph, in respect of the envious plotter? Night and day for the sake of this foolish people thou, like night and day, art a replenisher of life.",22
"Alas for those bilious ones who are without excellence! What excellence is born from bile? Headache. Do thou the same thing that the sun of the east does with (our) hypocrisy and craft and thieving and dissimulation. Thou art honey, we are vinegar in (the affairs of) this world and in religion; the (means of) removing this bile is oxymel. We folk who suffer from colic have added more and more vinegar; do thou add more and more honey, withhold not thy bounty. This was meet in us; such (acts naturally) issued from us: what is increased by sand in the eye? Blindness.",22
"(But) ’tis meet in thee, O precious collyrium, that every nothing should gain from thee something. Thy heart is roasted by the fire of these unrighteous men, (yet) all thy appeal (to God) has been, “Guide my people!” Thou art a mine of aloes-wood: if they set thee afire, they will fill this world with otto of roses and sweet basil. Thou art not that aloes-wood that is minished by the fire: thou art not that spirit that is made captive by grief. Aloes-wood burns, (but) the mine of aloes-wood is far from burning: how should the wind (of evil words) assail the source of (spiritual) light?",22
"Oh, ’tis from thee the heavens have (their) purity; oh, thy unkindness is better than kindness, Because if an unkindness come from the wise it is better than the kindness of the ignorant. The Prophet said, “Enmity (proceeding) from wisdom is better than the love that comes from a fool.” How an Amír harassed a sleeping man into whose mouth a snake had gone. A wise man was riding along (at the moment when) a snake was going into the mouth of a man asleep. The rider saw that, and was hurrying to scare away the snake, (but) he got no chance (of doing so).",22
"Since he had an abundant supply of intelligence, he struck the sleeper several powerful blows with a mace. The strokes of the hard mace drove him in flight from him (the rider) to beneath a tree. There were many rotten apples which had dropped (from the tree): he said, “Eat of these, O you in the grip of pain!” He gave the man so many apples to eat that they were falling out of his mouth again. He was crying, “O Amír, pray, why have you set on me? What have I done to you?",22
"If you have an inveterate and mortal feud with me, strike with your sword and shed my blood at once. Ill-omened (was) the hour I came into your sight: oh, happy he that never saw your face! Without guilt, without sin, without (having done) anything great or small—(even) the heretics hold not such oppression allowable. Blood gushes from my mouth together with (my) words. O God, I beseech Thee, give him the retribution (which he deserves)!” Every instant he was uttering a new curse, (while) he (the rider) kept beating him and saying, “Run in this plain.”",22
"Blows of the mace, and the rider (swift) as the wind! He (therefore) went on running and (now and) again falling on his face. He was full-fed and sleepy and fatigued: his feet and face became (covered with) a hundred thousand wounds. Till nightfall he (the rider) drove (him) to and fro, until vomiting caused by bile overtook him. All the things he had eaten, bad or good, came up from him: the snake shot forth from him along with what he had eaten. When he saw the snake outside of him, he fell on his knees before that beneficent man.",22
"As soon as he saw the horror of that black, ugly, big snake, those griefs departed from him. “Truly,” said he, “you are the Gabriel of (Divine) mercy, or you are God, for you are the lord of bounty. Oh, blest (is) the hour that you saw me: I was dead, you have given me new life. You (were) seeking me like mothers (in search of their children); I (was) fleeing from you like asses. The ass flees from his master because of asininity; his owner (runs) after (him) because of good-nature.",22
"He seeks him, not on account of profit or loss, but in order that a wolf or (other) wild beast may not tear him. Oh, happy he that espies your face or suddenly lights upon your abode. O you whom the pure spirit hath praised, how many foolish and idle words have I spoken to you! O lord and emperor and amír, I spoke not, my folly spoke: do not punish that (offence). If I had known a tittle of this matter, how could I have spoken foolish words?",22
"I should have spoken much praise of you, O man of good qualities, if you had given me a single hint as to the (actual) case; But you, keeping silence, showed perturbation and silently continued to beat me on the head. My head became dizzy, the wits flew out of my head— especially as this head has (but) little brain. Pardon, O man of goodly countenance and goodly behaviour: let pass that which I said in frenzy.” He answered, “If I had uttered a hint of it, your gall would instantly have turned to water.",22
"Had I told you the qualities of the snake, terror would have made you give up the ghost.” Mustafá (Mohammed) said, ‘If I should tell aright the description of the enemy which is in your souls, The gall-bladders even of courageous men would burst: he (such a one) would neither go his way nor care for any work. Neither would there remain to his heart endurance in supplication, nor to his body strength for fasting and (ritual) prayer. He would become (good for) nothing as a mouse before a cat; he would be distraught as a lamb before a wolf.",22
"No power to plan or move would remain in him: therefore I tend you without speaking. I am mute, like Bú Bakr-i Rabábí; I handle the iron, like David, So that by my hand the (seemingly) impossible is brought to pass, and wings are restored to the bird whose plumes were torn away. Since there is (the text) the hand of God is above their hands, the One (God) has declared our hand to be His hand. Therefore mine is surely a long hand that has passed beyond the Seventh Heaven.",22
"My hand showed (its) cunning upon the sky: O teacher of the Qur’án, recite the moon hath been cleft asunder.’ This characteristic, moreover, is on account of the weakness of (men's) understandings: how is it possible to explain the (Divine) omnipotence to the weak? You will surely know when you lift your head from (this sensuous) sleep. ’Tis the end (of my discourse), and God knows bestwhat is right. “(If I had told you about the snake), you would not have been able to eat, nor would you have been capable of vomiting or cared (to do so). I heard (your) abuse and went on with my work; I kept repeating under my lip (breath), ‘O Lord, make (it) easy!’",22
"I had not permission to speak of the cause, and I had not power to abandon you. From the grief in my heart I was saying continually, ‘Guide my people; verily, they know not’.” The man that had been delivered from woe was falling on his knees and saying, “O (thou who art) my bliss, O my fortune and treasure, Thou wilt get rewards from God, O noble one; this weakling has not the power to thank thee. God will say thanks to thee, O leader; I have not the lips and the chin and the voice for that.”",22
"Of this fashion is the enmity of the wise: their poison is gladness to the soul. The friendship of the fool is woe and perdition: hear this tale as a parable. On putting trust in the fawningness and good faith of the bear. A dragon was pulling a bear (into its jaws); a valiant man went and succoured it. The valiant (holy) men are a help in the world when the wail of the oppressed reaches (them). From every quarter they hear the cry of the oppressed and run in that direction, like the mercy of God.",23
"Those buttresses for the breaches of the world, those physicians for hidden maladies, Are pure love and justice and mercy; even as God, they are flawless (incorruptible) and unbribed. (If you ask one of them), “Why dost thou give him this aid all at once?” he says, “On account of his grief and helplessness.” Lovingkindness is fallen a prey to the valiant (holy) man, (for) medicine seeks naught in the world but the pain (which it should cure). Wherever a pain is, the remedy goes there: wherever a lowland is, the water runs there.",23
"If thou want the water of mercy, go, become lowly, and then drink the wine of mercy and become drunken. Mercy upon mercy comes (and rises like a flood) up to the head; do not thou come down to (and dwell upon) a single mercy, O son! Bring the sky under thy feet, O brave one! Hear from above the firmament the noise of the (celestial) music! Put out of thine ear the cotton of evil suggestion, that the cries from heaven may come into thine ear. Purge thy two eyes from the hair of defect, that thou mayst behold the garden and cypress-plot of the world unseen.",23
"Eject the phlegm from thy brain and nose, that the wind of God may come into the centres of thy (spiritual) sense of smell. Do not leave (in thyself) any trace of fever and bile, that thou mayst get from the world the taste of sugar. Remedium virilitatis adhibe neu virilitate carens cucurreris, that a hundred kinds of fair ones may come forth. Tear the fetter, which is the body, from the foot of thy soul, so that it may race round the arena. Take off the shackle of avarice from thy hands and neck: seize (and enjoy) a new fortune in the old heaven.",23
"And if thou art unable (to do that), fly to the Ka‘ba of (Divine) grace: lay thy helplessness before the Helper. Lamentation and weeping are a mighty stock-in-trade (resource); the Universal Mercy is the mightiest nurse (to comfort and cherish). The nurse and mother seeks a pretext (for giving relief): (she waits to see) when her child will begin to weep. He (God) created the child, (namely) your wants, in order that it might moan and that milk might (then) be produced for it. He said, “Call ye upon God!” Refrain not thou from lamentation, in order that the milk of His loving kindnesses may flow.",23
"The howling of the wind and the pouring forth of (rain like) milk from the cloud are for care of us: (have) patience one moment! Hast not thou heard (the text) “in the sky is your daily bread”? Wherefore hast thou stuck to this low place? Deem thy fear and despair to be the voice of the ghoul drawing thine ear (down) to the abyss of degradation. Every call that draws thee upward—know that that call has come from on high. Every call that excites cupidity in thee—know that it is the howl of the wolf which tears men (to pieces).",23
"This (afore-mentioned) height is not (high) in respect of position; these “heights” are towards (refer to) mind and spirit. Every cause is higher than the effect: the stone and iron (from which fire is struck) are superior to the sparks. Such and such a person is (really) seated above that one who lifts up his head so haughtily, though in appearance he is seated beside him. The superiority of that (person's) place is in respect of (his spiritual) nobility; the place (that is) far from the (spiritual) seat of honour is held in slight regard. Forasmuch as the stone and iron are prior in action, the superiority of these twain is proper;",23
"But those sparks, in respect of their being the final cause, are from this point of view far in front of (superior to) the iron and stone. The stone and iron are first, and the sparks last; but these twain are the body, and the sparks are the soul. If those sparks are posterior in time, (yet) in quality they are higher than the stone and iron. The bough is prior to the fruit in time, (but) it (the fruit) is superior to the bough in excellence. Since the fruit is the final cause of the tree, it follows that the fruit is (really) first, the tree last.",23
"When the bear cried out for help against the dragon, a valiant man rescued it from the (dragon's) claws. Cunning and courage gave support to each other: by this strength he slew the dragon. The dragon has strength, (but) it has not cunning; again, there is a cunning above your cunning. When you have regarded your own cunning, go back (and see) whence it came: go to the origin. Whatever is below has come from above: come on, turn your eye towards the height.",23
"Looking aloft gives light, though at first it produces dazzlement as a trial. Accustom your eye to the light; if you are not a bat, look in that direction. Vision of the end is the sign of your (having the) light; the lust of the moment is in truth your (dark) grave. The man with vision of the end, who has seen a hundred artifices, is not like him that has (only) heard of one artifice, (And who) has been so befooled by that one artifice that in his pride he has become alienated from the masters.",23
"Like Sámirí, when he has seen in himself that (little) skill, through pride he has rebelled against (a) Moses. He has learned that skill from (a) Moses and (then) closed his eyes to his teacher. Moses, of course, exhibited another artifice, so that it swept away (both) that artifice (of Sámirí) and his life. Oh, many is the knowledge (talent) that runs in the head (and urges) that he (the owner) should become eminent—in truth, through that (knowledge) his head goes (he loses his life). If you wish not your head to be lost, be (lowly as) a foot: be under the protection of the Qutb who is possessed of discernment.",23
"Though you be a king, deem not yourself above him: though you be honey, gather naught but his sugar-cane. Your thought is the outward form, and his thought is the soul: your coin is false, and his coin is (pure as) the mine. You are (really) he: seek yourself in his “he” (personality). Say coo, coo: become a dove (flying) towards him. And if you are unwilling to serve the (holy) men of (human) kind, you are in the dragon's mouth, like the bear. It may be that a Master will deliver you and pull you out of danger.",23
"As you have no strength, keep making a lamentation; since you are blind, take care, do not turn your head away from him that sees the road. You are less (worse) than the bear, (for) you are not wailing at the pain. The bear was freed from pain when it made an outcry. O God, make our stony hearts (soft as) wax; make our wailing sweet (to Thee) and an object of (Thy) mercy! How a sightless beggar said, “I have two blindnesses.” There was a blind man who used to say, “Pity! I have two blindnesses, O people of the time. Therefore, hark ye, show unto me twice as much compassion, since I have two blindnesses, and I (live) between (them.)”",23
"(Somebody) said, “We see one blindness of yours: what may the other blindness be? Explain.” He answered, “I have an ugly voice and unpleasing tones: ugliness of voice and blindness are double (blindness). My ugly cry becomes the source of annoyance: the people's love is lessened by my cry. Whithersoever my ugly voice goes, it becomes the source of anger and annoyance and hatred. Double your compassion for (these) two blindnesses: make room (in your hearts) for one who gets so little room.”",23
"The ugliness of (his) voice was diminished by this plaint: the people became of one mind in (showing) compassion for him. When he had told the secret (and explained his meaning), his voice was made beautiful by the graciousness of the voice of his heart; But that one whose heart's voice also is bad—(for him) those three blindnesses are banishment everlasting (from the favour of God); Yet it may be that the bounteous (saints), who give without cause, will lay a hand (of blessing) upon his ugly head. Since his (the blind beggar's) voice became sweet and pitiable, the hearts of the stonyhearted were made (soft) as wax thereby.",23
"Inasmuch as the infidel's lament is ugly and (like) braying, for that (reason) it meets with no (favourable) response. “Be silent” has come down (has been revealed in the Qur’án) against the ugly-voiced (infidel), for he was drunken with the people's blood, like a dog. Inasmuch as the lament of the bear attracts compassion, (while) your lament is not like this, (but) is unpleasing, Know that you have behaved with wolfishness to (a) Joseph, or have drunk of the blood of an innocent. Repent, and empty yourself of what you have drunk; and if your wound is old (and unhealed), go, cauterise (it).Continuation of the story of the bear and of the fool who had put trust in its good faith.",23
"The bear, too, when it was delivered from the dragon and received such kindness from that brave man— Like the dog of the Men of the Cave, that poor bear became an attendant at the heels of him that bore the burden (of the fight with the dragon). That Moslem, from fatigue, laid down his head (to rest); the bear, from devotion (to him), became (his) guard. A certain man passed by and said to him, “What has happened? O brother, who is this bear (in relation) to you?” He recounted the adventure, and the story of the dragon. The other said, “Do not set your heart on a bear, O fool!",23
"The friendship of a fool is worse than (his) enmity: it (the bear) ought to be driven away by every means you know.” He (the man with the bear) said (to himself), “By God, he has said this from envy; otherwise,” (he said aloud), “why do you look at the bearishness (of the bear)? Behold this affection (which it has for me)!” “The affection of fools,” said the other, “is beguiling; this envy of mine is better than its (the bear's) affection. Hey, come with me and drive away this bear: do not choose the bear (as your friend), do not forsake one of your own kind!” “Go, go,” said he, “mind your own business, O envious man!” Said the other, “This was my business, and it was not your fortune (to follow my advice).",23
"I am not less than a bear, O noble sir: abandon it, in order that I may be your comrade. My heart is trembling with anxiety for you: do not go into a forest with a bear like this. This heart of mine has never trembled in vain; this is the Light of God, not pretence or idle brag. I am the true believer who has become seeing by the Light of God. Beware and beware! Flee from this fire-temple!” He said all this, and it entered not his ear: suspicion is a thick barrier to a man.",23
"He took his hand, and he (the man with the bear) withdrew his hand from him. The other said, “I will go, since you are not a well-guided friend.” “Go,” cried he; “be not troubled for me; don't carve (retail) so much wisdom, O meddlesome one!” He answered him, (saying), “I am not your enemy: it would be a kindness if you would come after me.” “I am sleepy,” said he; “let me alone, go!” He replied, “Pray, give in to your friend, So that you may sleep under the safeguard of a sage, under the protection of one loved (by God), a man of heart (spiritual insight).”",23
"The man was thrown by his (the other's) earnestness into a (groundless) fancy: he became angry and quickly averted his face, Thinking, “Mayhap this man has come to attack me—he is a murderer; or he has hope (of gain)—he is a beggar and a tout; Or he has wagered with his friends that he will make me afraid of this companion.” From the wickedness of his heart, not (even) one good surmise came into his thoughts at all. His good opinions were wholly for the bear: to be sure, he was of the same kind as the bear.",23
"Through currishness, he suspected a sage and deemed a bear affectionate and just. How Moses, on whom be peace, said to one who worshipped the (golden) calf, “Where is (what has become of) thy vain scepticism and precaution?” Moses said to one drunken with (deluding) fancy, “O thou who thinkest evil because of (thy) unblessedness and perdition, Thou hast had a hundred suspicions concerning my prophethood, notwithstanding these proofs and this noble nature (which I have shown). Thou hast seen from me hundreds of thousands of miracles, (and all the time) a hundred fancies and doubts and (vain) opinions were growing in thee. Thou wert sorely pressed by fancy and devilish suggestion, thou wert sneering at my prophethood.",23
"I raised up dust from the sea before your eyes, so that ye might be delivered from the wickedness of the people of Pharaoh. During forty years the platter and tray (of food) came (to you) from heaven, and at my prayer the river ran from a rock. These (miracles) and a hundred times as many, and all these diverse (evidences), did not make that vain imagination fade away from thee, O cold (hard-hearted) man! Through sorcery a calf lowed; (then) thou didst fall to worship, saying, ‘Thou art my God.’ (Then) those imaginations were swept away (as) by a flood, and thy silly shrewdness went to sleep.",23
"How wert not thou suspicious in regard to him (Sámirí)? Why didst thou lay thy head (on the ground) like that, O ugly one? How did no idea come to thee of his imposition and of the corruptness of his fool catching magic? Who, indeed, is a Sámirí, O ye curs, that he should hew up a God in the world? How didst thou become of one mind (with him) as to this imposture of his, and become devoid of all perplexities? Is a cow (calf) worthy to be deified on (the strength of) a vain boast, (while there are) a hundred disputes as to the prophetic mission of one like me?",23
"Through asinine dullness thou didst cast thyself down in worship before a cow (calf); thy understanding fell a prey to Sámirí's magic. Thou didst steal thine eye away from the Light of the Glorious (God): here is plenteous folly for thee and the essence of perdition! Fie upon such an understanding and (faculty of) choice as thou hast! ’Twere fitting to kill a mine of folly like thee. The golden calf uttered a cry; prithee, what did it say, that all this desire (for it) blossomed in the fools? Ye have seen from me many a thing more wonderful than that, but how should every rascal accept God?”",23
"What carries away (enraptures) worthless folk? Worthlessness. What pleases futile folk? Futility, Because every kind is carried away (enraptured) by its own kind: how should the ox turn its face towards the fierce lion? How should the wolf bear love for Joseph, unless, perchance, through cunning, in order to devour him? When it is delivered from wolfishness, it will become familiar (with him); like the dog of the Cave, it will become one of the sons of Adam. When Abú Bakr smelt (made his first acquaintance with) Mohammed, he said, “This is not a face that lies;”",23
"(But) since Bú Jahl was not of those in sympathy (with Mohammed), he saw a hundred cleavings of the moon, and believed not. The sorrowful (lover of God), whose bowl has fallen from the roof—we (would) hide the Truth from him, (but) it does not become hid; While he that is ignorant (of God) and a stranger to His sorrow (love)—how often has it been shown, and he has not seen it! The mirror of the heart must be clear, in order that you may know therein the ugly form from the beautiful. How the madman sought to ingratiate himself with Jálínús (Galen), and how Jálínús was afraid.",23
"Jálínús said to his companions, “Let (one of you) give me such-and-such a medicine.” Then said that person to him, “O master of (many) sciences, this medicine is sought (as a cure) for madness. Far be this from thy intellect! Say no more (about it).” He replied, “A madman turned his face to me, Looked pleasantly on my face for a while, made little eyes at me, and plucked my sleeve. Had there not been in me congeniality with him, how would that ill-favoured man have turned his face towards me?",23
"Had he not seen (in me) one of his own kind, how should he have approached? How should he have thrown himself upon (attached himself to) one of another kind?” When two persons come into touch with each other, without any doubt there is something in common between them. How should a bird fly except with its own kind? The society of the uncongenial is the grave and the tomb. The cause of a bird's flying and feeding with a bird that is not of its own kind. Said a certain sage, “I saw a crow running about with a stork. I marvelled long, and I investigated their case, in order that I might find the clue (as to) what it was that they had in common.",23
"When, amazed and bewildered, I approached them, (then) indeed I saw that both of them were lame.” In particular, (how should) a royal falcon, which is of the highest heaven, (consort) with an owl, which is of the low earth? That one is the sun of ‘Illiyyún, while the other is a bat which belongs to Sijjín. That one is a luminary, free from every defect, while this (other) one is a blind man begging at every door. That one is a moon that strikes (its beams) upon the Pleiades, while this (other) one is a worm that cleaves to dung.",23
"That one has the face of a Joseph, the breath of a Jesus, while this (other) one is a wolf or an ass with a bell. That one has flown to Spacelessness, while this (other) one is in the straw-barn, like the dogs. With the tongue of (unspoken) meaning the rose is saying to the beetle this—“O stinking (creature), If thou art fleeing from the rose-bed, doubtless that aversion (shown by thee) is (a sign of) the perfection of the rose-garden. My jealousy (sense of dignity) smites thee on the head with a baton, (warning thee to) keep far away from here, O vile one;",23
"For if, base wretch, thou shouldst mix with me, it will be thought that thou art of my stock. For nightingales the garden is the proper place; for the beetle the best home is in ordure.” Since God has kept me pure from filth, how were it seemly to appoint a foul one for (companionship with) me? I had (in me) a vein of them (of their nature). He (God) cut it out: how (then) will he with the vein of evil attain unto me? One mark of Adam from eternity was this, that the angels should lay their heads (on the ground) before him, because it was his place (proper to his dignity).",23
"Another mark was that Iblís, saying, “I am the king and chief,” should not lay down his head before him. But if Iblís too had become a worshipper (of Adam), he (Adam) would not have been Adam: he would have been another. At once the worship of every angel is the test of him, and the denial (of him) by that enemy (Iblís) is the proof of him. At once the acknowledgment (made) by the angels is witness for him, and the disbelief of that petty cur (Iblís) is witness for him. How Mustafá (Mohammed), on whom be peace, went to visit the sick Companion; and an exposition of the profit of visiting the sick. A notable amongst the Companions (of Mohammed) fell ill, and in that illness of his became (thin) as a thread. Mustafá went to visit him, since his (Mustafá's) nature was all kindness and generosity. There is profit in your visiting the sick: the profit thereof is returning to you again. The first profit is that the sick person may perchance be a Qutb and a glorious (spiritual) king;",23
"And if he be not a Qutb, he may be a friend of the (Súfí) Way; if he be not the king, he may be the cavalier of the host. Deem it, then, incumbent (on you) to attach yourselves to the friends of the Way, whosoever it may be, and whether (he be) footman or rider. And if he be a foe (to you), still this kindness is good, for by kindness many a foe hath been made a friend; And though he do not become a friend, his enmity is lessened, because kindness becomes the balm for enmity. There are many profits besides these, but I am afraid of being tedious, good friend.",23
"The gist (of the matter) is this: be the friend of the whole community (of Súfís): like the idol-maker, carve a friend out of the stone, Because the throng and multitude of a caravan will break the backs and spears of the highwaymen. Inasmuch as you have not the heart's two eyes, O contumacious man, so that you cannot distinguish firewood from aloes- wood, (You may despair of finding the true friend of God; but) since there exists a treasure in the world, do not grieve: deem no ruined place empty of treasure. Betake yourself to every dervish at random, and when you find the mark (of the true saint), frequent (him) assiduously.",23
"As the inward-seeing eye was not (granted) to you, think always (that) the treasure (may be) in everybody. How the high God revealed to Moses, on whom be peace, (the words), “Wherefore didst not thou visit Me in sickness?” To Moses there came from God this reproach: “O thou who hast seen the rising of the moon from thy bosom, Thou whom I have illumined with the Divine Light! I am God, I fell sick, thou camest not.” Moses said, “O Thou transcendent in Thy glory, Thou art clear of loss (defect). What mystery is this? Explain this, O Lord!” God said unto him again, “Wherefore in My sickness didst not thou kindly ask after Me?”",23
"He answered, “O Lord, Thou hast no imperfection. (My) understanding is lost: unfold (the meaning of) these words.” God said, “Yea; a favourite and chosen slave (of Mine) fell sick. I am he. Consider well! His excusability (infirmity) is My excusability, his sickness is My sickness.” Whoever wishes to sit with God, let him sit in the presence of the saints. If you are broken off (divided) from the presence of the saints, you are in perdition, because you are a part without the whole. ",23
